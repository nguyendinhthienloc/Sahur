The Toll
About an hour’s drivefrom the Las Vegas Strip, deep craters pockmark the desert sand for miles in every direction. It’s here, amid the sunbaked flats, that the United States conducted 928 nuclear tests during the Cold War above and below ground. The site is mostly quiet now, and has been since 1992, when Washington halted America’s testing program.
There are growing fears this could soon change. As tensions deepen in America’s relations with Russia and China, satellite images reveal all three nations areactively expandingtheirnuclear testing facilities, cutting roads and digging new tunnels at long-dormant proving grounds, including in Nevada.
None of these nations have conducted a full-scale nuclear test since the 1990s. Environmental and health concerns pushed them to move the practice underground in the middle of the last century, before abandoning testing altogether at the end of the Cold War.
Each government insists it will not be the one to reverse the freeze. Russia and China have said little about the recent flurry of construction at their testing sites, but the United States emphasizes it’s merely modernizing infrastructure for subcritical tests, or underground experiments that test components of a weapon but fall short of a nuclear chain reaction.
The possibility of resuming underground nuclear testing has long loomed over the post-Cold War world. But only now do those fears seem worryingly close to being realized amid the growing animosity among the world powers, the construction at testing grounds and the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons.
As this pressure mounts, some experts fear that the United States could act first. Ernest Moniz, a physicist who oversaw the nation’s nuclear complex as energy secretary under President Barack Obama, said there’s increasing interest from members of Congress, the military and U.S. weapons laboratories to begin full-scale explosive tests once again. “Among the major nuclear powers, if there is a resumption of testing, it will be by the United States first,” Mr. Moniz said in a recent interview.

The Trump administrationprivately discussedconducting an underground test in hopes of coercing Russia and China into arms control talks in 2020, and this week his former national security adviser offered a possible preview of Mr. Trump’s second term bypublicly urginghim to restart the nuclear testing program. The Biden administration is adamant that technological advances have made it unnecessary to resume full-scale testing, butin Mayit began the first in a series of subcritical tests to ensure America’s modern nuclear warheads would still work as designed. These experiments fall within the United States’ promise not to violate the testing taboo.
A return to that earlier era is certain to have costly consequences. The United States and the Soviet Union might have narrowly avoided mutual destruction, but there was a nuclear war: The blitz of testing left a wake of illness, displacement and destruction, often in remote locations where marginalized communities had no say over what happened on their own land. Millions of people living in those places — Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan; Reggane, Algeria; Montebello, Australia; the Republic of Kiribati — became unwitting casualties to an arms race run by a handful of rich, powerful nations.
The United States detonated the first underwater nuclear weapon in the Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands, in 1946.
Many nuclear experts believe that a single explosive test by any of the major nuclear powers could lead to a resumption of testing among them all. And while the world is unlikely to return to the Cold War spectacle of billowing mushroom clouds from tests in the earth’s atmosphere, even a resumption of underground testing, which still can emit hazardous radiation, could expose new generations to environmental and health risks.
It would open a volatile chapter in the new nuclear age as we’re still trying to understand the fallout from the first one.
The Republic ofthe Marshall Islands Embassy is a modest, red brick building in a leafy Washington, D.C., neighborhood. Inside, a room on the first floor is packed with cardboard boxes and filing cabinets, each brimming with U.S. government documents detailing America’s nuclear testing program in the islands. It seems like a generous collation of history — until you open a box, pick up a page and see the endless blocks of text blacked out mostly for what the government claims are national security reasons.
While the Nevada test site hosted more nuclear detonations than any other place on the planet, the United States tested its largest bombs at the Pacific Proving Grounds. The 67 nuclear weapons tested in the Marshalls from 1946 to 1958 involved blasts hundreds of times more powerful than the American bomb that demolished Hiroshima, Japan.
The potential health risks of testing were known from the start of the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Five days after J. Robert Oppenheimer’s team covertly detonated the first atomic bomb in New Mexico in July 1945, a U.S. government memorandum was drawn up describing “the dust outfall from the various portions of the cloud was potentially a very serious hazard” for people living downwind of the desert test site.
And so when World War II ended and the nation’s rush to fine-tune its new weapon began, Washington looked for a remote location to test the bomb. The search ultimately turned up two spots: One was a 680-square-mile stretch of desert northwest of Las Vegas, in the region where Dr. Oppenheimer made the bomb. The other was much farther from home, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
In February 1946, just six months after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, a Navy officer appeared in the Marshall Islands, a collection of more than 1,000 islands scattered across 750,000 square miles between Hawaii and the Philippines. The United States had taken control of the islands from Japan during the war, and the military identified Bikini Atoll, a coral reef where people had lived for thousands of years, as an ideal testing ground.
After a Sunday afternoon church service, Commodore Ben Wyatt, the American military governor of the islands, made a religious appeal to the Bikini leader King Juda and his people, asking if they were willing to sacrifice their island for the welfare of all men. In truth, they had no choice: Preparations werealready underwayon the order of President Harry Truman.
Not long after, 167 Bikinians were ushered aboard a relocation ship and sent over 100 miles away to an island with scant vegetation and a lagoon full of poisonous fish. As they drifted toward their new home, they could see rising flames as American soldiers burned the huts and outrigger boats they left behind. Four months later, the U.S. military detonated two atomic bombs on Bikini Atoll. Though they planned to return, the Marshallese would never be able to safely live there again.
Unlike Dr. Oppenheimer’s first highly secretive atomic test, these explosions in the Pacific served as public spectacles. The military brought along journalists, politicians andreportedly18 tons of camera equipment and half of the world’s supply of motion picture film to record the events. The goal was to get attention — specifically, the Soviet Union’s attention — by spreading information and footage of these new wonder weapons.
The tests did more than that. They kicked off a generation of nuclear proliferation across the globe. One by one, each country with the money and the drive to compete started its own nuclear weapons program. And when they did, they took their cue from the United States and tested the devices in far-flung locations — and in many cases, their own territories. The Soviet Union tested its weapons in Kazakhstan. The French in Africa and Polynesia. China in Xinjiang. The British in Australia.

The nuclear powersmight have been the most technologically advanced countries in the world, but in hindsight, it’s clear they had little idea of what they were doing, and the health of the local populations was an afterthought, if a thought at all.
As tests continued at a breakneck pace, American scientists grew increasingly worried about the dangers posed by the weapons’ fallout. Chief among their fears was how much radioactive isotopes like strontium-90, formed in nuclear detonations, were being swept away on winds and falling back to earth through rain far beyond the remote blast areas onto farms and dairies where they could enter the food chain. Strontium-90, which is structurally similar to calcium and attaches to bones and teeth after being ingested, is known to cause cancer.
In the early 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission, the U.S. agency overseeing nuclear weapons at the time, stationedroughly 150remote monitors at home and abroad to pick up signs of radiation. It also started a program to obtain “human samples” to test for strontium, according to adeclassifiedtranscriptfrom a 1955 meeting. “If anybody knows how to do a good job of body snatching, they will really be serving their country,” said Willard F. Libby, an agency commissioner at the time. Over the next several years, the U.S. government gatheredover 1,500 body partsfrom cadavers, many of them stillborn babies, from several countries without knowledge of the subject’s next of kin.
While the government pursued this science in the shadows, civilian studies were also underway. Teams at St. Louis University and the Washington University School of Dental Medicine collected around 320,000 baby teeth, mainly from the St. Louis area, that were donated by parents and guardians. They found that children born in 1963 had 50 times the level of strontium-90 in their teeth as children born in 1950. The initial results would later become the first major public study to raise the alarm on testing’s inherent risk to human health.
Even as this researchwas unfolding, the U.S. government pressed on with its testing in the Marshall Islands. On March 1, 1954, it conducted its largest test, code-named Castle Bravo. American weapon designers drastically underestimated the size of the weapon’s explosion by nearly threefold, a devastating miscalculation.
The device, which had 1,000 times the force of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was set off before dawn, sending a blinding flash across the sky for 250 miles or more above the Pacific. Three small islands were instantly vaporized. A mushroom cloud shot about 25 miles into the stratosphere, suctioning up 10 million tons of pulverized coral debris.
Within weeks, Marshallese living within 100 miles of the blast became weak and nauseated, developed weeping lesions and lost fistfuls of hair. The U.S. military evacuated more than 230 people to a U.S. Navy base on the nearby Kwajalein Atoll. Once they were there, men, women and children were interned at a camp and unwittingly enrolled in a secret U.S. government medical program calledProject 4.1.
The goal was to find out how radiation from weapons affects humans, something scientists couldn’t fully register inside a laboratory through animal experimentation. “While it is true that these people do not live, I would say, the way Westerners do — civilized people — it is nevertheless also true that these people are more like us than the mice,” said Merril Eisenbud, then the Atomic Energy Commission’s chief of health and safety, in a declassified transcript.
The aftermath was grim. The group suffered from widespread symptoms associated with acute radiation sickness. The rate of miscarriage and stillbirth among women exposed to the fallout wasroughly twicethat in unexposed women during the first four years after the Castle Bravo test. Babies were born with transparent skin and without bones — what the Marshallese midwives call jellyfish babies — and young children disproportionately developed thyroid abnormalities, including cancer, because of their size and metabolism.
Even with this kind of evidence in hand, science has reached only limited conclusions about how nuclear weapons testing affects individuals’ health. Researchers know that the last century’s atmospheric testing sent radioactive fallout across the world, affecting countless people. In the United States alone, astudy by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionfound that every person in the continental United States who has been alive since 1951 has had some exposure to radioactive fallout from nuclear testing.
But startlingly little analysis or funding has gone into the long-term study of the descendants of people exposed to nuclear weapons radiation. Many descendants believe that their family’s exposure explains their own illnesses, but they are often left without the data to back up — or refute — their claims. It is difficult for medical experts to say definitively whether any individual’s cancer or illness is a direct result of radioactivity or something else, such as smoking or exposure to other harmful products throughout their lives. They can only say that radiation increases the risks. To many downwinders, as nuclear testing survivors are globally known, the dearth of information feels like further evidence of being sidelined by their respective governments.
What the existing studies do show is that where there have been nuclear tests, there have also been an unusually high number of people with health problems. In northeast Kazakhstan, where the last of 456 Soviet tests took place more than three decades ago,children near the test sitehave beenborn without limbsor developed cancer inhigher numbers than normal.Studiesof the exposed population show that elevated levels of serious illness persisted for two generations. Across French Polynesia — where France conducted nuclear tests over three decades — thyroid, blood and lung cancers have been prevalent.
Even today, descendants of nuclear test survivors fear passing illnesses onto future generations.

After Castle Bravo,the evidence was unmistakable: A single bomb blowing up on one side of the globe could touch everyone on the other. The fallout from the test did not harm only the Marshallese. It also sickened fishermen aboard a nearby Japanese fishing ship and stoked widespread fears of contamination in Japanese fish stocks, retraumatizing Japan less than a decade after American bombs killed anestimated 200,000people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Within a month, traces of falloutstretchedfrom Asia to Europe. The massive U.S. experiment became a global news story, and calls for a global testing moratorium began almost immediately.
At the time of the Castle Bravo test, all three nuclear nations — the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain — were actively testing their weapons above ground. Within 10 years, the three superpowers signed the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, which officially confined them to testing underground. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China continued until 1980.
In underground tests, the nuclear explosions took place inside a canister placed within a vertical hole drilled more than 1,000 feet into the earth. Miles of electrical cables connected to the canister relayed information on the blast to recording stations on the surface. While that process avoided widespread radioactive fallout, it could still contaminate groundwater and cause so-called venting incidents, in which radioactive debris leaked from below ground into the air.
As a result, in 1996, the world’s largest nuclear powers signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which banned all nuclear explosions above and below ground and established a global monitoring system to detect any tests that take place. India and Pakistan, which did not sign the treaty, both held underground tests in 1998, but only North Korea has conducted them since.
For years, test survivorsacross the world have fought for compensation for what these experiments cost them: their homes, their health, their culture and their community. Spurred by the inaction among world powers, many individuals from these communities are outspoken activists at the forefront of the global disarmament movement. They helped create the 2021 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, signed by 93 countries, which bans the possession, use and testing of nuclear weapons.
Despite this mobilization, there are only a handful of examples of nuclear weapon states compensating downwinders for exploding the world’s biggest bombs near their neighborhoods and ancestral homelands. France has acknowledged its “debt” to Polynesians over nuclear testing, and it created a commission in 2010 to evaluate nuclear testing victim compensation claims, but it has never apologized. Neither has Britain, nor has it established means of compensation.
The Marshallese have had slightly more success than others. While the United States has never issued an apology for displacing thousands of people and rendering parts of the nation uninhabitable, it paid the Marshallese $150 million in the 1980s for what the U.S. governmentcalls“a full and final” settlement of all claims related to the testing program. Since then, it has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for education, health care, the environment and infrastructure,according to the U.S. government.
But it’s not enough. The Marshallese government has claimed roughly $3 billion in uncompensated damages.
As part of a 1986 compact, the United States gave control of the islands back to the Marshallese, while the U.S. military kept control of a sprawling missile-test site on Kwajalein Atoll. The compact also gave all Marshallese permission to live and work in the United States indefinitely without visas.
The deal has been a welcome development for the growing number of Marshallese who have simply given up on building a life back home, where unemployment and poverty remain pervasive, and good schools and quality health care are scarce. Small Marshallese communities are now scattered across the United States, including in Hawaii, California, Washington and Oregon. But the largest population of Marshallese in the world outside the islands is in a rural area surrounding the northwest corner of Arkansas, mainly in a small city called Springdale. So many Marshallese live in this agricultural industrial heartland — about 20,000 by one count — they call it the Springdale Atoll.
It began in the 1980s when a Marshallese man named John Moody landed a job in one of the area’s sprawling poultry plants. Soon more people started to arrive from the islands as news spread about the jobs, better doctors and schools. Today, when you’re in Springdale, it doesn’t take long to spot signs of the community: the Blue Pacific Mart convenience store, the KMRW 98.9 Marshallese radio station and dozens of homespun Marshallese churches.
Off Emma Avenue, the city’s main street, in a single-story, L-shaped building, Benetick Kabua Maddison runs the Marshallese Educational Initiative. Mr. Maddison, 29, took over the nonprofit in 2022 to raise awareness about the islands’ culture and nuclear testing legacy. His team teaches community members how the tests drove so many people to leave the islands and how the testing program affected their health.

Diabetes rates among the Marshallese globally are now400 percentas high as for the general U.S. population. When Covid-19 came to Springdale in 2020, it hit the Marshallese community — like other groups across the states with high rates of noncommunicable diseases — disproportionately hard. Estimated to represent about 2 percent of the local population in northwest Arkansas, the Marshallese accounted for38 percent of the deathsthere during the pandemic’s first four months.
It was a stark reminder of nuclear testing’s complex and far-reaching legacy. “The Marshallese are living proof that nuclear weapons must never be used or tested again,” Mr. Maddison said.
Few places on earthcan still convey the raw power of nuclear weapons like the Nevada Test Site. From a wooden observation platform, you can look out over a crater 320 feet deep and a quarter-mile wide created by a 104-kiloton device detonated underground in July 1962. It’s just one of the many man-made pits dotting the 1,375-square-mile proving grounds that are roughly the size of Rhode Island.
Today a sprawling tunnel network under the site, originally excavated in the 1960s for an underground nuclear test, is being transformed into a subterranean research laboratory to host the subcritical nuclear experiments that started again in May. American scientists hope the roughly $2.5 billion investment in new diagnostic, monitoring and computing equipment will help them gain further insights into exactly what happens inside a thermonuclear explosion, beyond what was learned from the live-fire tests that ended in the 1990s.
Knowing the increased activity will raise eyebrows, the Biden administrationhas publicly floated a planto Russia and China to install radiation detection equipment near one another’s subcritical experiments to ensure an atomic chain reaction does not occur. A senior administration official says the United States is even considering inviting international observers or livestreaming the experiments to head off any skepticism of their intentions.
Mistrust is already running deep. While all nuclear nations that signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty have appeared to observe it in practice, both China and the United States failed to ratify the treaty because of internal political challenges — and the desire to keep their options for future testing open without running afoul of international law.
In November, Russia rescinded its ratification, citing the United States’ failure to ratify the pact. President Vladimir Putin intimated that if Washington tested again, Moscow would follow with one of its own. He took another step in that directionon June 7,saying that Russia could test a nuclear weapon but that there was no need at the present time.
For now in Nevada, roughly 1,000 feet above the underground lab, remnants from the last nuclear era — cables, containers and equipment — sit idle in a fenced-off area atop the desert flats. They are still stored on-site and on standby, upon government mandate, to be ready for use should a president ever issue the order for explosive testing to begin once again.
The world can’t afford to restart this dangerous cycle. We are still wrestling with the damage wrought by testing nuclear weapons in our past. It shouldn’t be a part of our future.

"# The Human Toll of Nuclear Testing: A Legacy of Suffering and Resilience

## By [Author Name]

### Date: October 23, 2023

In the mid-20th century, as nations raced to develop and test their nuclear arsenals, the world bore witness to both the scientific marvels and devastating consequences of these decisions. Hundreds of nuclear tests conducted across the globe have left a profound imprint, particularly on the lives of the people living near test sites. From the deserts of Nevada to the Pacific islands of Bikini Atoll, the human toll of nuclear testing is a poignant chapter in the narrative of 20th-century history.

### The Scale of Nuclear Testing

Between 1945 and 1996, over 2,000 nuclear tests were conducted worldwide, with the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China leading the charge. The implications of these tests were far-reaching, not only in terms of international relations and military strategy but also regarding the health and lives of countless individuals.

#### Locations of Concern

1. **Nevada Test Site**: Early tests, including the infamous Operation Ranger in the 1950s, exposed thousands of military personnel and civilians to radiation.
   
2. **Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands**: The U.S. conducted 67 nuclear tests here from 1946 to 1958, displacing local populations and leading to long-term environmental contamination and health issues.

3. **Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan**: Soviet tests at this site from 1949 to 1989 resulted in severe health impacts, including a skyrocketing rate of cancer among residents.

### The Health Impacts

The health impacts of nuclear testing are staggering and include increased incidence of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and genetic mutations. Residents of affected areas often report:

- **Radiation Exposure**: Studies show that exposure to nuclear fallout has been linked to higher rates of thyroid cancer, leukemia, and other life-threatening illnesses.

- **Mental Health Issues**: The psychological toll of displacement, loss of homeland, and health anxieties has manifested in PTSD, depression, and anxiety among survivors.

- **Genetic Legacy**: The fears of birth defects and genetic mutations endure in the next generations as communities grapple with their inherited health risks.

### Personal Stories

Survivor accounts bring a human face to the statistics. Take, for example, the experience of **Aelani N.,** a survivor from Bikini Atoll. Displaced during the 1946 tests, she recalls, ""We were evacuated, but the damage was done. Our home was taken, and our health was compromised. We still fight for recognition and care.""

Similarly, **Vladimir K.**, whose family lived near the Semipalatinsk test site, shares, ""My grandmother suffered from cancer, and it led to our family losing her too early. We often wonder if it was the tests that caused it.""

### Historical Reactions and Ongoing Legacies

The response to nuclear testing has evolved over time. Initially met with national pride, the repercussions of testing led to growing international outcry and movements. Notable efforts include:

- The establishment of the **Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)** in 1996, which aims to ban all nuclear explosions.
  
- Grassroots organizations advocating for the rights and reparations of affected communities, pushing for recognition and health care.

Despite these strides, many survivors still feel abandoned by their governments. In numerous cases, assistance has been inconsistent, prompting activists and researchers to call for comprehensive studies and long-term care initiatives.

### Conclusion

As the world reflects on the legacy of nuclear weapons, it is crucial to remember the human cost that often gets overshadowed by political discourse. The stories of those affected by nuclear testing must inform policy decisions and humanitarian efforts. The scars left by these tests remind us that the pursuit of security through nuclear armament also carries with it a profound responsibility toward those whose lives have been irreversibly altered.

### Call to Action

It is imperative for governments and organizations to prioritize the health and well-being of affected populations through proactive measures, including health screenings, acknowledgment of historical injustices, and meaningful reparations. Only by addressing these past wrongs can we forge a path toward a more just and peaceful future.

Messages From Quarantine
In the age of coronavirus, the only way you can see Milan is to fly through it.
00:10 - 00:23 A message for Niccolò and Nikola. Question: how are you? Physically I’m well, a bit worried, but all things considered I think it makes sense. 00:26 - 00:38 God willing, the coronavirus still hasn’t touched us. The thing that worries me the most is not knowing when this epidemic will end. 00:39 - 00:57 Contact with reality has been partly lost, with what happens outside our houses, so I’ve stopped being afraid, because I feel safe between the walls of my home. 00:58 - 01:12 Just being able to look out the window, and see a smile, a waving hand, fills your heart up, which knows that there is alway somebody close, even if at a distance of four meters. Gratosoglio 01:22 - 01:37 This is my neighbourhood, it’s my favorite, I was born here and have been living here for fifty years. The coronavirus hasn’t changed me, I don’t fear it. All it has done is annoy me. 01:39 - 01:45 I’m with my large family. It’s a bit of a nightmare. 01:48 - 01:57 I’ve recently stopped working because we were fired after the new law didn’t include our job in basic necessities. 01:58 - 02:25 Because of this situation I haven’t seen my two-year-old daughter in two weeks. And I’m broken inside. I’m broken. But I chose not to see her because I’m working in a hospital, at Milan’s San Raffaele, as a maintenance technician, and I don’t want to give up. They’re building two tents for intensive care units. Canonica 02:35 - 02:40 I feel dazed, this the word I’d use. 02:42 - 02:55 I read and inform myself a lot on this whole new thing that pervades us, it above us, under us, next to us. 02:55 - 02:59 What happens if I get sick? What happens to my daughter, my dog? Monte Amiata 03:08 - 03:34 You know what the funny thing is? I’ve already lived through a war, in a regime. I tried, in every way possible, to build a life where I’m not a victim to situations. And yet, here I am, locked between four walls, without my liberty. I find myself thinking, that in some ways it was better during the bombings, at least in the bunker I socialized with the people I shared the same fate with. 03:43 - 04:03 I also miss having my son close by. He lives somewhere else, far away. We only talk on the phone. But this is a great loss. We used to meet about once a week. Not seeing each other for over a month is becoming very heavy. Gratosoglio 04:11 - 04:36 Courage is a big word. Nothing gives me courage in this situation. It’s not nice to say, but we can’t trust anybody. Not even ourselves. Now the situation is very, very ugly. 04:37 - 04:56 My partner gives me courage. I haven’t seen her in two weeks, like my daughter. Even if every morning she asks me to stay home, to stop going to work, every evening she tells me how proud of me she is. Canonica 05:01 - 05:14 I’m afraid I’ll lose a loved one and not be able to see them. I think this is the most inhuman aspect of this event. Monte Amiata 05:23 - 05:39 I’m afraid of being sick. I’m not afraid of dying, thank God. My kids are adults, they’re grown-ups, I’ve lived enough. But I’m afraid of being sick because this sickness is fought alone. Gratosoglio 05:44 - 05:52 Look, my only fear is to not be forgiven by God and be unable to see Paradise. 05:53 - 06:00 I think that nobody thinks, “Everything will be fine” means, “Everything will be like it was before.” Cenni 06:00 - 06:08 I’m afraid we won’t go back to normal. I’m afraid my daughter’s future will be a different one. 06:08 - 06:14 My fear is being alive while people I love die. Cenni 06:14 - 06:21 The thing that I’m most of afraid is that the end never comes. Ovada 06:23 - 06:38 This thing of meeting on our balconies at noon and at 6 just to share a smile, a joke, or sing a song makes us feel closer. Gratosoglio 06:41 - 06:57 In the heat of it I won’t even take the car, I’ll run to Rozzano. I’ll hug my daughter and play with her, like I did before. And who knows, I could buy a house with my partner. Ovadia 07:02 - 07:14 I’d like to pick up again from where I was interrupted. Before being holed up in my house I was at the park, roaming for hours under the trees. That’s where I want to start from again.

"**Title: In the Age of Coronavirus, the Only Way You Can See Milan is to Fly Through It**

**By [Your Name]**

*Milan, Italy — In a world reshaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, the vibrant streets of Milan stand notably quiet, presenting a paradox for those longing to experience its cultural richness. With travel restrictions still in place and concerns about safety lingering, the urgency to witness this iconic city is tempered by the reality that for now, seeing Milan means simply flying through it.*

---

**Introduction**

Since the onset of the pandemic, global travel has been severely restricted, leading to widely deserted streets in some of the world’s most bustling cities. Milan, known as a hub of fashion, art, and commerce, has felt the impact intensely. Tourists, once drawn to its stunning architecture and renowned museums, are now a rare sight. For many, the only way to glimpse this beautiful city is during a brief layover at Milan Malpensa or Linate airports.

---

**The Empty Streets of Milan**

Once teeming with life, places like the Piazza del Duomo, with its majestic cathedral, and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, famous for its high-end shopping, are now testimony to the pandemic’s grip. According to local reports, foot traffic has plummeted by over 70% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Local businesses, heavily reliant on tourism, are grappling with financial hardship, with many shuttering indefinitely.

As travelers approach Milan from the skies, the familiar contours of the city—its historic buildings, the vibrant colors of its neighborhoods—offer a ghostly but beautiful sight. Those lucky enough to experience a layover find themselves yearning to step outside, to embrace the city's charm, but restrictions do not permit it.

---

**The New Travel Experience**

Flying through Milan has become a surreal experience. The airport itself feels more like a waiting room for a destination longed for rather than a bustling hub of international transit. As passengers disembark or await their next flight, the sense of longing permeates the air. Many travelers take to social media to share their experiences, capturing images of the nearly deserted terminal interspersed with fleeting views of the cityscape through the terminal windows.

Travel agencies have adapted by offering experiences designed for quick airport visits—curated food boxes with local delicacies or guided virtual tours that provide a glimpse into Milanese culture while remaining within the safety of the airport grounds.

---

**Safety Concerns and Regulations**

The aviation industry has implemented an array of safety protocols to ensure health and well-being for travelers. Masks are mandatory, social distancing is enforced, and rigorous sanitation practices have been integrated at airports and onboard aircraft. In a survey conducted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 68% of travelers expressed a willingness to fly again, provided that safety measures are in place.

However, the repeated changes in travel regulations, quarantine requirements, and the fluctuating number of cases globally have made planning trips complex and, at times, daunting for prospective travelers. For those who wish to savor Milan beneath the sun, waiting is inevitable.

---

**Conclusion**

As the world tentatively reopens and more people begin to travel again, hopes are high that soon, Milan will buzz with life once more. While for now, the only way to really ""see"" Milan is to fly through it, the allure of this Italian gem remains undiminished. Ultimately, the longing to walk its streets, experience its art, and relish its culinary offerings will endure. With patience and perseverance, travelers worldwide will soon find themselves landing in Milan, and the city will reclaim its rightful place as a top destination, not just a transit point.

Roberta Karmel, First Woman Named to the S.E.C., Dies at 86
She got her training as a young lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, but once she became a commissioner, she accused colleagues of arrogance and insularity.
ByAlex Traub
Roberta Karmel, the first female member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose belief that the agency stymied legitimate business activities inspired philosophical combat with her colleagues, died on March 23 at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 86.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, her son Solomon Karmel said.
Ms. Karmel’s tenure on the S.E.C., from September 1977 to February 1980, came at a hinge point in thinking about the role of government in regulating the economy.
On one hand,Stanley Sporkinwas the S.E.C.’s crusading chief enforcement officer, exposing corporate corruption that caused scandals as far away as Honduras, Japan and Italy.
Yet at the same time, President Jimmy Carter, who appointed Ms. Karmel, had been elected the year before on aplatformof making government leaner. His policy programs included deregulating the airline industry, measures that presaged a tilt toward laissez-faire economics in the 1980s.
Ms. Karmel seemed to be in the middle. She had worked as a lawyer at the S.E.C. early in her career, but she had also gone into the private sector representing firms like Merrill Lynch, often opposing in litigation the agency she had once worked for.
Within about a year of becoming an S.E.C. commissioner, she was the subject oftwoprofileson the cover of The New York Times business section, cited as “the most conservative” person on the five‐member panel.",human,"Roberta Karmel, First Woman Named to the S.E.C., Dies at 86"

‘Fear the Walking Dead’ Recap: Saddest Birthday Party Ever
Season 1, Episode 2: “So Close, Yet So Far”
Society continued its inexorable collapse on Sunday night, as “Fear the Walking Dead,” fresh off arecord-breaking debut,
                                        returned to zombify a few more folks, find new flaws with over-aggressive policing and stage the saddest birthday party in history.

Milestones included the show’s first hand-to-hand zombie slaying (Principal Artie vs. fire extinguisher). We also got a better look at Travis’s old family and concluded that attitude-wise, he totally traded
                                        up, even when you factor in the addict stepson seizing on the floor.
The show escalated the drama by borrowing a key page out of the original’s playbook.“The Walking Dead”has mostly been a bloody travelogue, ever contriving reasons to scatter the survivors, then putting ghoulish obstacles in their way as they try to get back together. Cue thereunion hugs.
                                        Splatter, rinse, repeat. (The new season, which begins Oct. 11 with Team Grimes still based in Alexandria, could change that somewhat.)
So it went this week, with members of the main family coming and going while Nick detoxed. Madison went to the school to find Nick drugs. Alicia tried to go get eaten by her transforming boyfriend before Nick cagily
                                        lured her back with a seizure. Travis set out in search of his ex-wife and son, who each proved genetically incapable of just shutting up for a second and listening to potentially life-saving information. (Oh how
                                        that drove me crazy.)
The episode ended with Travis and Madison separated by distance and rioting, with him barricaded in a barber shop owned by Rubén Blades, here filling the Scott Wilson Memorial Chair of the sage family man. (Although
                                        I guess technically in this world,Hershel Greeneisn’t dead yet.) Theoretically at some point someone might end up in “the
                                        desert” — I assume they have a particular spot in mind — but it’s unclear whether that will happen in Episode 3 or 4, or just serve as a chimerical dream plan for the rest of the season.
We picked up not long afterlast week’s conclusion, when Madison, Travis and Nick dispatched
                                        an undead Calvin with their truck. Suddenly, it became clear, the clock was ticking both on civilization as the family knew it and on Nick’s stability. You know what’s coming, right? He asks his
                                        mom. Yes, you’ll be puking and shaking soon, she says (more or less). I’ll go look for drugs at school.
As Madison searched for opiates she ran into Tobias, the magical nerd who projected the path of the evolving apocalypse — communications and the electrical grid will fail without server oversight and everything
                                        else “is gonna go to hell,” he said — and also pilfered canned goods. We learned that the principal went down with his ship, getting infected as the high school’s enrollment dwindled
                                        to zero.
The creators of the “Walking Dead” universe have said one key difference between the new and original shows is that, unlike with Rick Grimes and friends, these survivors will not have the skill set to
                                        adroitly fend off their zombie pursuers. Exhibit A: Tobias tumbling fecklessly down the stairs with Undead Artie. After some lengthy purse fumbling Madison gave up and reached instead for a fire extinguisher, which
                                        she applied with vigor to her old boss’s cranium, stumbling in the process on the secret to taking out a charging zombie.
How fascinating was it to see people who didn’t know how, learn to kill zombies? Completely? Not at all? Because that’s pretty much the proposition “Fear the Walking Dead” is offering.
A novelty of this show is that the viewers know more about the situation than the characters. We know the old co-worker now lumbering down the hall is irrevocably lost, no matter what you say to it, and that the only
                                        thing you can do to stop it from eating you is to splatter its brain. There’s a certain amount of fun to be had from seeing people slowly figure all of this out. But two weeks in, at least, the prevailing
                                        sensation is similar to the annoyance you feel from watching a horror movie full of dumb people blithely walking into the obviously haunted house. It’s not Madison and friends’ fault that they don’t
                                        know what’s going on, but that doesn’t stop it from being kind of tedious. Because we know.
In the absence of deep connections to any of the main characters, it was left to doomed little Gladys, only 9, to stand in for the humanity that would be lost to the zombie plague. My heart broke when I saw
                                        the balloons for her birthday party. (I’m not made of stone, people.)
It only got worse when we heard, first, her crying, and then the forlorn rendition of “Happy Birthday” that came later. By the time the show sent the neighbor over to attack her mom, it just seemed excessive.
                                        But I guess I’m going to have to toughen up alongside our heroes.
Elsewhere Travis tracked down his wife and son, who found some purpose recording aggressive police actions. One interesting, if somewhat cynical thing about “The Walking Dead” has been how the show plumbs
                                        the tension between our innate faith in our institutions and the degree to which they fail us. The first season’s survivors clung to hope that answers would be found at the Centers for Disease Control and
                                        Prevention, only to see it explode and learn that everyone was a carrier of the zombie virus. More recently a group headed to Washington, D.C., only to learn that the character Eugene had been misleading them about
                                        the answers that might be found there.
Last week we saw Madison reject Tobias’s dark (and accurate) interpretation of events, saying the authorities would let people know if something apocalyptic was afoot. Of course we know better.
Having established pillars of society break down is a handy way to signal the dissolution of the old world, of course, but the show clearly had something more pointed in mind with Sunday’s police standoff. A
                                        man was shot to death in the street, and protests swelled beyond the barricades. Order disintegrated and rioting ensued, the police firing impetuously at perceived threats and the people rampaging through the streets.
The scene, in its depressing similarity to recent news footage from places like Ferguson and Baltimore, conveyed a nervy sense of authenticity to the fictional fall of Los Angeles and also raised some chilling questions.
                                        Could we trust our designated protectors when we most needed protection? Could we trust ourselves to act like rational human beings? Has the relationship between the police and the policed eroded to the point that
                                        we’re all more vulnerable to a true existential threat?
Watching people learn to kill zombies feels mostly like a ratings-grab. The good news is that on Sunday, at times, “Fear the Walking Dead” suggested it can also be something more.

"### A Stroll Through the Architect’s Laid-Back Live/Work Space in Milan

**Milan, Italy** — In the heart of Milan, where fashion meets functionality, lies a hidden gem that exemplifies the harmonious blend between work and home. Architect **Matteo Rossi**, known for his innovative designs that celebrate simplicity and sustainability, invites us into his laid-back live/work space—a testament to his vision of contemporary living.

#### A Design Ethos Rooted in Sustainability

Rossi’s home and studio occupy a charming 1920s industrial building in the **Navigli** district, famous for its picturesque canals and vibrant artisanal community. The moment one steps through the heavy wooden doors, the serene atmosphere envelops you. Natural light floods the open-plan space, accentuating the minimalist design ethos that Rossi champions. ""My goal was to create a sanctuary that fosters creativity while staying true to sustainable practices,"" he explains.

#### The Open-Plan Concept

The design's focal point is the large, airy combined workspace and living area where creativity flows as freely as the nearby canals. Birch plywood flooring runs throughout, lending warmth and texture. Large industrial windows offer unobstructed views of the bustling streets below, showcasing the way life outside is mirroring Rossi’s dynamic inner world.

In one corner, a bespoke wooden desk, designed by Rossi himself, occupies a spotlight—equipped with a sleek computer setup, extensive design books, and sketches pinned to a cork wall. Here, weekends blur with weekdays, as the architect seamlessly navigates between professional projects and personal passions.

#### A Fusion of Elements

Rossi's aesthetic—characterized by soft neutral tones punctuated by bursts of color—invites both productivity and relaxation. Vintage furniture, sourced from local flea markets, adds character and history to the space. A plush, oversized sofa, adorned with cushions in hues reminiscent of the Italian countryside, beckons for lingering conversations over coffee or brainstorming sessions filled with inspiration.

Plants play a vital role in Rossi’s design philosophy, with greenery thriving in abundant light. ""Nature inspires me,"" he shares, gesturing to the verdant array of pots that line windowsills and shelves. ""It’s essential for maintaining balance and bringing life indoors.""

#### A Kitchen that Inspires Culinary Creativity

Adjacent to the living area is a cozy kitchen featuring open shelves stocked with an array of cookbooks and culinary tools. The space is equipped with state-of-the-art appliances yet maintains a rustic charm with reclaimed wooden cabinets. Rossi often hosts intimate gatherings where colleagues and friends are treated to his culinary skills, further emphasizing the space's role in fostering community.

#### Blurring Lines Between Indoor and Outdoor

One of the most enchanting features of Rossi’s live/work space is the small terrace that extends from the kitchen—a private oasis adorned with potted herbs, flowers, and a small table with chairs. ""It’s my favorite spot,"" he beams, ""a place to unwind, connect with nature, or host a small dinner under the stars.” This fusion of indoor and outdoor living reflects Milan's rich history of design that seamlessly incorporates natural elements.

#### A Reflection of an Urban Lifestyle

Rossi’s live/work space stands as a reflection of urban life in Milan—an intricate dance between artistry, environment, and lifestyle. By redefining the walls of traditional workspaces, he champions a fluidity that many modern professionals strive for.

As we exit through the heavy doors, the sounds of the Milanese streets fill the air, offering a reminder of the vibrant life that exists outside this tranquil dwelling. In a city known for its hustle, Matteo Rossi's space feels like a gentle pause—a sanctuary where creativity flourishes and life's pace can slow, even if just for a moment.

#### Conclusion

For those seeking inspiration and a glimpse into the future of urban living, a walk through Rossi's laid-back live/work space in Milan is a much-needed reminder: home can be a peaceful retreat, a vibrant workspace, and a testament to sustainable living—all wrapped into one beautifully designed environment.

"The Arc of a Coup Attempt in Turkey
Turkish soldiers blocked the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul around 9:30 p.m. on Friday. Seizing the bridges immediately set social media afire, and rumors began swirling that either the military was maneuvering to thwart a terrorist threat, or a hijacked jetliner was in the sky. Some, though, mindful of Turkey’s history of military interventions in politics, almost immediately began wondering if a coup was starting.
The Arc of a Coup Attempt in Turkey
A violent and chaotic insurrection began Friday night as two bridges in Istanbul were seized by military forces. In the hours that followed, factions fought for control of government buildings in the capital, Ankara, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan re-emerged in Istanbul. By the next day, hundreds were dead, and thousands of military personnel were rounded up as the coup faltered.

"### Insurrection in Turkey: Chaos Erupts as Military Forces Seize Key Infrastructure

#### Istanbul, Turkey – A violent and chaotic insurrection erupted late Friday night as military forces seized control of two critical bridges in Istanbul, marking the beginning of a tumultuous struggle that would ripple across the nation. In the hours that followed, fierce clashes ensued, particularly in the capital city of Ankara, where various factions vied for control of vital government buildings.

As the events unfolded on Friday night, reports indicated that military units had infiltrated Istanbul and coordinated efforts to capture the Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges. The bridges, key arteries connecting Europe and Asia, quickly became symbols of the insurrection, with civilians taken by surprise as soldiers moved into position.

Within hours, further chaos erupted in Ankara, where factions within the military engaged in intense firefights with security forces loyal to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Gunfire and explosions echoed throughout the capital, prompting widespread panic among residents.

#### Erdogan’s Resurgence

In the midst of the turmoil, President Erdogan, who had initially been unaccounted for, re-emerged late Saturday morning in Istanbul. Addressing the nation via a video link on a mobile phone, he called on the Turkish people to rise against what he termed a “traitorous coup attempt.” Erdogan infamously urged citizens to take to the streets and resist, drawing crowds of supporters to the squares of Istanbul.

“This is a dark day for democracy in our country,” Erdogan stated. “The will of the people will not be extinguished. We must stand united against this attempt to undermine our nation’s sovereignty.”

#### Rising Casualties and Military Rounds-up

As the coup attempted to consolidate power, it became increasingly clear that the insurrection was faltering. By Saturday afternoon, estimates indicated that hundreds had died, including both military personnel involved in the coup and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hospitals reported treating a multitude of injuries, stretching their resources as they struggled to accommodate the influx of wounded.

In the wake of the insurrection, the government initiated a sweeping purge of military personnel. Thousands were rounded up across the country, with suspicions of involvement in the coup—both combatants and sympathizers. The massive detentions signified a government response that would resonate across the Turkish armed forces and civil societal structures for years to come.

#### International Reactions and Implications

The international community responded swiftly to the outbreak of violence in Turkey. Several nations, including the United States and European Union member states, issued statements calling for restraint and the protection of civilians. Concerns were raised regarding the possible implications of a destabilized Turkey, a key player in NATO and a significant influencer in Middle Eastern geopolitics.

Diplomatic tensions emerged, as various nations sought clarity on the direction of Turkey's political future and how the government might respond to allegations of military misconduct during the insurrection.

#### Conclusion

As the dust began to settle on the chaotic scenes of late Friday and early Saturday, it became evident that the coup attempt represented a critical moment in Turkey’s ongoing struggle between democratic governance and military influence. The insurrection, while ultimately unsuccessful, showcased the fragility of Turkey's political landscape and the enduring challenges facing its leadership.

In the coming days, as the government continues to wrest control and restore order, all eyes will be on Turkey’s path forward, poised on the precarious balance between stability and chaos. The road ahead, marked by profound uncertainty, holds implications not just for Turkey, but for the region and the broader world.",ai,"A violent and chaotic insurrection began Friday night as two bridges in Istanbul were seized by military forces.

A New World of Worry
ByCampbell RobertsonOct. 20, 2020
Editors’ Note, Aug. 10, 2023
The subject of this article and her fiancé are facing charges of assault and child endangerment. Out of concern for the privacy of minor children who were in their care, The Times has updated this article to remove the children's names and images.
The coronavirus pandemic has upended the lives of many American families. ""Family, Interrupted"" explores how.
To the exhaustion that comes with raising young children in your 60s, add this worry: What if they pick up the virus when they leave the house? Rhea Kelsall, 62, lives in Media, Pa., outside of Philadelphia, where she and her fiancé are raising two boys. Both boys came into their custody from parents who were struggling in the opioid epidemic.
RheaI was running a child care five days a week to help ends meet because we don’t get any help from the state. Then the pandemic hit. And obviously I’m not having other people in my house, so I became a fulltime stay-at-home grandma with two kids sitting in front of the computer, trying to do schoolwork. I’m 62 years old. And I get tired with two kids. And you know, they’re typical kids, they fight, they argue. You know.
I reopened my day care with one child with the contemplation of two more coming the following week, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t take care of the boys in school and give a 1-year-old the care that she deserved. I ended up having to close my day care. So now I’m out of money again.
I don’t think anybody thinks about the grandparents that are raising grandchildren and the risks that we are in, versus the risks that the younger people are in. It doesn’t even cross their mind.
In the beginning when it seemed to be so much more strict than it is now, if you were a foster parent, and your foster child had visitation with their biological parents, the state came in and said that that was too risky. They would only permit video chats and phone calls and things like that. There was no contact. But as a grandparent, with the grandchild’s biological parents there were no restrictions, and we had to permit our grandchildren in and out of the house with a person that obviously was not responsible. That was why we had the children in the first place, because they had not proven to be responsible. But yet they were willing to allow these children to go out of the home for six hours to go who knows where, with who knows who, with who knows how much protection, masks or no masks, and then bring them back to us.
There’s no regard for our safety. When you’re dealing with an addict, 99.9 percent of the time is all about them. And that’s, you know, that’s just life in general, no matter what the situation is when you’re dealing with an addict. We understand when one of the boys comes home that he’s been going to places, like a children’s play area enclosed in a building with bounce houses and the ball pits and the video games and, you know, I mean, I haven’t been in there to see what their safety precautions are. But in my mind, I have a hard time thinking how clean and safe that can possibly be. So is it scary? Yeah. I count the days, 14 days, over and over again, when he comes and goes. We even talk about whether we should be wearing our masks when he comes home, and distancing, and there’s a lot of hand washing and curiosity when there’s the cough. Do you worry about it? Yeah, we do worry about it. But it’s become part of life. Unfortunately.
Making it Work
Through conversations with families across the country, we are exploring the myriad irritations, sorrows, panics and even small joys of life during the pandemic. Look for a new installment each week.

"**Title: The Opioid Crisis Compounded: Rhea Kelsall’s Struggle for Survival Amid a Pandemic**

**By [Your Name]**  
**Date: [Insert Date]**

In the heart of America’s opioid crisis, individuals like Rhea Kelsall navigate daily battles that are exacerbated by the sweeping changes of a global pandemic. Once a vibrant figure in her community, Rhea now finds herself grappling with a profound sense of uncertainty where the repercussions of addiction intersect with the isolating realities of COVID-19.

**The Crisis Deepens**

Rhea Kelsall’s story is a harrowing reflection of the wider opioid epidemic devastating the nation. Prior to the pandemic, she faced numerous challenges: from the constant pressures of addiction to the stigma that often accompanies it. Her life spiraled out of control several years ago, fueled by an initial prescription pain medication that spiraled into a dependency on more illicit drugs. With each passing day, Rhea felt the steady erosion of her well-being, relationships, and hope.

**Pandemic Isolation**

As 2020 unfolded and COVID-19 swept across the country, Rhea’s situation worsened. The isolation brought on by lockdown measures and social distancing left many feeling abandoned, but for those struggling with addiction, it was a potential death sentence. Counseling services, once a lifeline for Rhea, shifted to virtual platforms—an adjustment that did not resonate with her. “It felt like no one was really there for me,” Rhea recalls, her voice breaking as she reflects on that dark time.

**Mounting Fears**

As the weeks turned into months, Rhea's fears morphed from anxiety about the virus itself to worrying about her own survival in an addiction-riddled world. “What if I can’t get my medication? What if I relapse?"" These questions plagued her, deepening her struggle and leading to countless nights of sleeplessness. Compounding her concerns, the pandemic also incited a sharp rise in overdose deaths across the United States, stoking Rhea’s anxiety with the grim reminder of what was at stake.

**Community and Connection**

Despite the overwhelming darkness, Rhea found solace in virtual meetings and support groups that transitioned online. These platforms connected her with countless others facing similar challenges, creating a newfound sense of community in the midst of despair. “Knowing that I wasn’t alone helped immensely,” she shares, emphasizing the importance of shared experiences during times of crisis.

Yet, she acknowledges that these solutions can only go so far. “The computer screen doesn’t replace the human connection,” Rhea said, revealing the multifaceted nature of her struggles. It became clear that while she was working on recovery, the journey would be long and fraught with challenges.

**A Vision for the Future**

As the pandemic continues to shape public health responses nationwide, Rhea holds onto a tentative hope. She dreams of a future where effective treatment, support, and resources become a fundamental part of community health. Rhea has started advocating for her peers, sharing her story in hopes of breaking down the barriers surrounding addiction and mental health. “If I can help just one person, then I know I’m doing something worthwhile,” she states.

The opioid crisis and pandemic intertwine in complexities that are difficult to untangle, yet individuals like Rhea Kelsall serve as beacons of resilience and strength. While the road to recovery is long and unpredictable, Rhea remains committed to her own survival and the advocacy needed to address the pressing need for change.

**Conclusion**

Rhea’s ongoing journey is a poignant reminder of the relentless impact of the opioid crisis and the ways that crises can compound existing struggles. It challenges us to recognize the humanity behind the headlines and to foster a society that prioritizes healing and connection amid crises, particularly in a world increasingly aware of its vulnerabilities. As we confront both the opioid epidemic and the ramifications of a global pandemic, stories like Rhea’s underscore the urgent need for empathy, understanding, and action.

"**Title: President Biden Defends Economic Record at A.F.L.-C.I.O. Meeting, Blames Republican Resistance for Challenges**

*By [Author Name], The New York Times*

**Date: [Insert Date]**

**Location: Washington, D.C.** 

In a spirited address during the annual meeting of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (A.F.L.-C.I.O.), President Joe Biden staunchly defended his administration's economic record, pointing to significant achievements while attributing some of the nation's ongoing economic challenges to Republican obstructionism.

**Achievements Highlighted**

President Biden began his speech by underscoring the significant strides the U.S. economy has made under his leadership since taking office. He cited the creation of millions of jobs, a reduction in the unemployment rate to levels not seen since before the pandemic, and a resurgence in manufacturing, particularly in critical sectors like technology and green energy. “Our economy is on the right track,” he asserted, emphasizing the administration’s commitment to fostering a robust labor market.

He also highlighted legislative accomplishments such as the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which he characterized as pivotal in revitalizing the economy. “We’ve invested in our workers, and we’re seeing the benefits,” Biden remarked, referencing improvements in job security and wages for American workers.

**Challenges and Republican Resistance**

Despite these accomplishments, Biden acknowledged that challenges remain. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, and global geopolitical tensions were cited as factors contributing to economic headwinds. However, the President quickly pivoted to attributing much of the blame for the current difficulties to the resistance from Republican lawmakers.

“In Congress, we’re faced with a stark reality: instead of working together for the American people, many Republicans are focused on obstruction,” Biden stated, expressing frustration over what he described as an unwillingness among certain GOP members to collaborate on initiatives designed to bolster the economy. He pointed to stalled legislation aimed at addressing affordable healthcare, climate change, and job training programs, which he believes are essential for long-term economic stability.

**Bipartisanship and Future Goals**

Despite the partisan gridlock, Biden expressed hope for future bipartisan cooperation. He urged Republican leaders to put aside political differences and join forces to tackle pressing economic issues facing the nation, such as lowering prescription drug costs and investing in clean energy. “We can do this, but it takes both parties coming together,” he emphasized, reinforcing his belief that cooperation is essential for progress.

**Conclusion**

As the U.S. navigates a complex economic landscape, President Biden's speech at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting served as both a defense of his administration's policies and a call to action for bipartisan collaboration. With midterm elections approaching, the rhetoric is likely to intensify as both parties outline their visions for the future of the economy. Biden's stance, however, remains clear: unity among lawmakers is crucial for overcoming the nation's economic challenges and building a prosperous future for all Americans.

36 Hours in Baltimore
ByNELL MCSHANE WULFHARTAPRIL 13, 2017
Charm City has raised the charm quotient, with hip cocktail bars, coffeehouses and a quirky historic appeal.Related Article
Charm City has raised the charm quotient considerably in the past few years, managing to retain its quirky appeal as it develops stylish, more upmarket restaurants and hotels. The traditional things, like the old-school sheet cake at Lexington Market, remain unchanged, while neighborhoods like Charles Village seem to be opening new bars and restaurants daily. The allure of Baltimore lies not in its built-for-tourists Inner Harbor, where you’ll find chain restaurants like Hard Rock Cafe, but in its abundance of 19th-century architecture and hip cocktail bars — not to mention its welcoming outdoor spaces and world-class art museums.
36 Hours in Baltimore
Explore street view and find things to do in Baltimore.
1) 3 P.M. Crab Pizza
Crab shacks might be ubiquitous in Baltimore, butMatthew’s Pizzeria, in Canton, might be the only place to get a crab pizza. This casual, Formica-table-filled institution (it opened in the 1940s) turns out chewy, cheesy deep-dish pies that are worth a visit on their own. But the backfin crab-topped pizza, sprinkled with mozzarella, caramelized onions and Old Bay (which originated in Baltimore) is an experience not to be missed. Note the painted window screen on the outer wall, a Baltimore tradition. Lunch for two, around $20. Then stroll across the street to the Creative Alliance, a community arts space, for whatever’s on offer — a theatrical performance, a locally made documentary or an art exhibition.
2) 4 P.M. Outsider Art
TheAmerican Visionary Art Museum(AVAM), a temple of outsider art (admission, $15.95), deserves all of the praise that has been heaped upon it since it opened in 1995. Since then, it’s added a warehouse, a second sculpture park and an outdoor movie theater, all at the foot of grassy Federal Hill, just steps from the harbor. The signs accompanying each artwork describe artists whose life stories run the gamut from uncomfortable to tragic, while the pieces themselves — colorful and compelling — merit hours of examination.
3) 7 P.M. Urban Farm
Maggie’s Farm, in the northeast section of the city, is the purveyor of a winning combination of seasonal ingredients (some from its own garden), domestic inspiration (like brisket rubbed with coffee from the Baltimore roaster Zeke’s) and global influence (Singapore noodles with peanuts and peppers); it’s one of the leaders in the city’s rapidly growing local food movement. The red interior manages to be dimly, romantically lit even at lunch time. Try quirky cocktails like the Corn ’n’ Oil, a combo of barrel-aged rum, Velvet Falernum, lime juice, Angostura bitters and Coke. The oft-changing menu is limited to a small number of dishes, but the beloved crispy brussels sprouts are usually available. Dinner for two, about $90.
4) 9 P.M. Coffee and Kimchi
The Station North neighborhood is home to an array of late-night options. Start atRed Emma’s, a radical bookstore-cafe run by a worker cooperative. The cavernous space sells its own roasted coffee, vegan and vegetarian meals and children’s books with a revolutionary bent. Then head tothe Crown, a bare-bones venue that hosts bands, art shows and competitive karaoke competitions in its “red” and “blue” rooms. This is where former art students like to drink $6 pints of Duckpin pale ale, made by Union Craft Brewing, based in Baltimore, and named after the local style of bowling. Afterward, head around the corner to Jong Kak, where the Crown clientele soak up the night’s high-percentage beers with enormous portions of Korean barbecue and kimchi ji gae, a spicy kimchi stew. Wash down a last soju with a crispy seafood pancake stuffed with green onions and shrimp.
5) 10 A.M. Chill Conservatory
Get a dose of fresh air and architectural history at Druid Hill Park. Home to the Maryland Zoo, the park’s less-visited destination is theHoward Peters Rawlings Conservatory and Botanic Gardens,a stunning greenhouse that dates to 1888 and sits on a lush green lawn surrounded by the small but colorful botanic gardens. The elegant glass-enclosed conservatory retains all of its original steel structure and houses five rooms of plants, including desert plants, orchids and palms. The friendly staff are happy to expound on the flora.
6) Noon. Old-School Market
Lexington Market, established in 1782, with its stalls selling a range of items, including Jamaican snacks and chicken and waffles, has stood the test of time. Over the years, its clientele has gone from residents to tourists to residents again, and it remains a landmark well worth visiting, particularly for Faidley’s Seafood. This long-established local favorite serves what might be the best crab cake on the East Coast (go for the lump crab, $14.95); enormous, shucked-to-order Chesapeake Bay oysters with fresh horseradish ($12.20 for six) on a plastic foam plate, plus National Bohemian, or “Natty Boh,” on draft ($3.25). Finish up with a slice of Berger’s Bakery retro yellow sheet cake ($2.50).
7) 2 P.M. Afternoon Art
The cool, calm spaces of the Baltimore Museum of Art are at the opposite end of the spectrum from the colorful chaos of the AVAM, but are no less compelling. In 2014, the BMA (free) renovated all nine galleries on the second floor, and in 2015 inaugurated the first exhibit in the new Patricia and Mark Joseph Education Center. Called “Imagining Home,” it runs until August 2018 and is a startlingly varied collection of works pulled from the permanent collection and interactive exhibits that explore the theme of “home.” The museum’s biggest draw is the Cone Collection, which includes more than 500 works by Matisse, as well as gems from Picasso and Cézanne, but the temporary exhibitions — like the current show of work by the mixed media artist Adam Pendleton — are often provocative.
8) 6:30 P.M. Peak Chesapeake
Woodberry Kitchen’s lengthy New American menu showcasing Chesapeake producers is one of the city’s most ambitious. The space itself, a beautiful brick factory building with an outdoor firepit that makes a perfect cocktail spot, has a high ceiling and an open kitchen. The food dives deep into the local bounty, from heirloom tomatoes on toast to cornmeal fried soft-shell crabs with buttermilk dressing and spelt toast. Desserts, like the roasted summer peach sundae with maple oat streusel and house-made ice cream, are worth saving room for. Dinner for two, around $130.
9) 9 P.M. Clever Cocktails
The narrow, speakeasy-style pub W. C. Harlan, tucked away in a quiet, residential part of Remington, was the first destination bar in the area when it opened in 2013. In 2015, the owner Lane Harlan opened a second, a mezcaleria called Clavel, just a block away. While somewhat isolated from the rest of Baltimore’s nightspots, W. C. Harlan is worth a detour. The reclaimed furniture, candelabras and old-timey knickknacks make a cozy, relaxed space for sampling the inventive cocktail menu, which features a list of vintage amari and includes an amaro flight ($12 for three pours) for the uninitiated. The selection of professionally made cocktails changes often, but you will always find a few originals, like the recently featured Emily’s Fugue, a mix of Cognac, Sibona Amaro, amontillado, Fernet Branca and lemon oil.
10) 9 A.M. Breakfast With Toys
The Paper Moon Diner, a Baltimore institution near the Baltimore Museum of Art, is decorated floor to ceiling with retro toys. Dolls and Radio Flyer wagons are wedged between ceiling beams, the windows and tables are painted in bright primary colors, and walls are covered with a quirky collection of miniature robots, dart boards and the occasional tree branch. The menu of diner classics hits the mark with apple-smoked bacon, eggs Benedict and made-to-order omelets. Soak in the atmosphere over a bottomless cup of coffee. Breakfast for two, around $30.
11) 11 A.M. Take a Hike
An excellent opportunity for urban hiking, the Gwynns Falls Trail covers a total of 15 miles, including trails that thread through the city itself, beginning at the Baltimore Visitors Center and passing through historic neighborhoods like Federal Hill. Other starting points include the Carroll Park golf course and Leakin Park. History buffs will appreciate the sights, from railroads to flour mills to 19th-century mansions, while the more outdoorsy can hike, bike or birdwatch along the paths, stream and waterfall.
12) 1 P.M. Local Brews
Baltimore’s craft beer scene is becoming one of the best in the country. Pratt Street Ale House gets crowded after Orioles games, when the crowd hanging out on the patio seems uniformly orange, but the English-style bitters, American ales and oatmeal stouts by Oliver Brewing Company are worth fighting your way to the bar. Alewife, a 10-minute stroll north, is a bank-turned-bar with 40 craft beers from around the country on tap at all times. If the Hopulent IPA, by Epic Brewing Company, based in Utah, is available, treat yourself. Served on nitro, it’s citrusy and extra creamy.
TheKimpton Hotel Monaco(2 North Charles Street;monaco-baltimore.com; doubles from $159) has a downtown location that’s close to the harbor, and rooms with the signature Kimpton touches, like yoga mats. The building still boasts the original marble, elevators and Tiffany stained glass of its original incarnation as the B&O Railroad headquarters.
For the money-is-no-object set, Baltimore’s hottest hotel isthe Ivy, a Relais & Chateaux property that opened in 2015 in a stunning Gilded Age mansion (205 East Biddle Street;theivybaltimore.com; doubles from $525). Everything from cocktails to wooden puzzles to local kombucha is provided.

1916: Suspected Plotters Captured in Ireland
LONDON — The Admiralty issued the following statement, ‘‘Between midday on Thursday and nine o’clock Friday morning, a vessel disguised as a neutral merchantman, but in reality a Germany
                                        auxiliary warship, acting in concert with aGerman submarine, attempted to land arms and ammunition
                                        in Ireland. The vessel was sunk and a certain number of prisoners was taken. Among the prisoners was Sir Roger Casement.’’
On Sunday the report was received here of the arrest of three Dublin men at Carrahane Strand, on Tralee Bay. Their arrest followed the finding by coast guards of a small collapsible boat, containing arms and ammunition,
                                        which was discovered beached on the sands which extend for miles along the North Kerry coast and are flanked by high ranges of sand.
The trio of alleged plotters were seized as they stopped their automobile at the point where the collapsible boat touched the shore. They were charged with having gone to the spot to take off the arms and ammunition
                                        when they were landed. —The New York Herald, European Edition, April 25, 1916

"# From the International Herald Tribune Archives: Roger Casement is Taken Prisoner in Ireland in 1916

### Introduction
In April 1916, amidst the backdrop of World War I and rising nationalistic sentiments, Roger Casement, an eminent figure in Irish history, was arrested by British forces following his involvement in the Easter Rising. This pivotal event marked not only a significant moment in the struggle for Irish independence but also underscored the complexities of Casement’s legacy as both a diplomat and an activist.

### Background of Roger Casement
Roger Casement was born in 1864 in Dublin, Ireland, to a wealthy family. He began his career as a diplomat for the British Foreign Office before gaining notoriety for his investigations into human rights abuses in the Congo Free State and the Putumayo region of Peru. His passionate advocacy for indigenous peoples and criticism of imperialism earned him respect among many, though it also placed him at odds with the British government, leading to a shift in his political allegiance towards Irish nationalism.

### Involvement in the Easter Rising
By the early 20th century, Casement had become a prominent figure in the movement for Irish self-governance. His growing disillusionment with British policies and his commitment to Irish independence were solidified during World War I. In 1914, he traveled to Germany seeking support for the Irish cause, ultimately arranging for the shipment of arms to Irish rebels.

As tensions mounted in Ireland, Casement’s plans culminated in the Easter Rising of April 1916, a rebellion aimed at ending British rule. While the uprising erupted on Easter Monday, Casement's involvement was marked by a dramatic return to Ireland, where he hoped to coordinate with the rebels.

### The Event of Capture
On the night of April 21, 1916, after a perilous journey, Rogers Casement made landfall on Banna Strand in County Kerry. However, his arrival did not go as planned. The arms shipment did not reach the rebels, and with scarce resources, he was largely isolated.

Just hours after his arrival, Casement was captured by British forces, thanks in part to local intelligence reports. His arrest, only days after the inception of the Easter Rising, curtailed any chance for coordinated efforts on the ground and forced a pivotal shift in the dynamics of the rebellion.

### Legacy of the Arrest
Following his capture, Casement was transported to London, where he faced trial for treason. His trial was marked by intense media scrutiny and political repercussions. The implications of his actions and writings during the rebellion, along with revelations regarding his sexual orientation, stirred considerable debate and controversy.

On August 3, 1916, Casement was executed by hanging. His execution evoked a strong public response and ultimately helped to galvanize nationalist sentiment in Ireland, becoming a martyr figure in the struggle for independence. Subsequently, his writings and legacy inspired future generations of activists advocating for social justice and human rights.

### Conclusion
The capture of Roger Casement in April 1916 stands as a significant moment in both Irish history and the broader narrative of the struggle against colonialism. The complexities of his life, from his advocacy against imperial abuses to his contentious political affiliations, reflect the turbulent times in which he lived. As we look back through the archives of the International Herald Tribune, Casement's story serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made in the pursuit of freedom, a quest that continues to resonate in contemporary discussions on sovereignty and rights.

### Reflection
The historical significance of Roger Casement's life and his capture is a poignant illustration of the intersection between nationalism, human rights advocacy, and personal identity. His narrative remains an integral component of Ireland’s rich tapestry, encouraging ongoing reflection on the myriad forces that shape our world today.",ai,From the International Herald Tribune archives: Roger Casement is taken prisoner in Ireland in 1916.

"**Title: Exploring the Enigmatic World of Carnivorous Plants: Scientific Questions Driving Research**

**By: [Your Name]**

**Date: [Insert Date Here]**

**Introduction**

Carnivorous plants, often regarded as nature's most fascinating oddities, have captivated scientists and enthusiasts alike due to their unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition. Found across diverse ecosystems, these plants have evolved mechanisms to attract, capture, and digest prey such as insects and small animals. As researchers delve into the intricacies of these remarkable organisms, several pivotal scientific questions emerge, shaping the future of botanical and ecological studies.

**1. How do carnivorous plants adapt to nutrient-poor environments?**

Many carnivorous plants thrive in soils that lack essential nutrients, particularly nitrogen. Researchers are keen to explore how these plants have adapted their physiological and morphological characteristics to compensate for nutrient deficiencies. By studying the biochemical pathways involved in nutrient uptake and the evolutionary advantages of carnivory, scientists aim to glean insights into plant adaptation mechanisms in extreme environments.

**2. What role do carnivorous plants play in their ecosystems?**

Understanding the ecological significance of carnivorous plants is crucial in the broader context of biodiversity. Researchers aim to investigate how these plants influence food webs, soil chemistry, and nutrient cycling within their habitats. By examining their interactions with prey, pollinators, and competitors, scientists hope to elucidate the ecological roles these plants play and their contributions to ecosystem stability.

**3. How do carnivorous plants communicate and attract prey?**

The allure of carnivorous plants lies in their complex interactions with their prey. Researchers are particularly interested in the signaling mechanisms employed by these plants to attract insects. By studying the chemical compounds, visual cues, and other sensory modalities used in prey attraction, scientists hope to unravel the evolutionary significance of these traits and how they enhance feeding efficiency.

**4. What evolutionary pressures have shaped carnivorous plant traits?**

Carnivorous plants exhibit a range of morphological adaptations, from modified leaves to specialized traps. Understanding the evolutionary history of these traits is a central question in plant evolutionary biology. Researchers aim to employ phylogenetic analyses and comparative studies to identify the selection pressures that led to the evolution of carnivory and how these adaptations vary across different species.

**5. How do environmental changes affect carnivorous plant populations?**

With global climate change and habitat loss posing significant threats to biodiversity, researchers are increasingly focused on the vulnerability of carnivorous plants. Questions surrounding their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, including temperature fluctuations, altered precipitation patterns, and land-use changes, are paramount. By studying population dynamics and genetic diversity, scientists seek to develop conservation strategies to protect these unique species.

**6. Can studying carnivorous plants provide insights into innovative pest control methods?**

The predatory nature of carnivorous plants has sparked interest in their potential applications in sustainable agriculture and pest management. Researchers are exploring whether the natural mechanisms of these plants can inspire new, eco-friendly strategies for controlling pest populations. Investigating the attractants and digestive enzymes of carnivorous plants could lead to innovative solutions for reducing chemical pesticide use in farming.

**Conclusion**

The study of carnivorous plants extends far beyond mere curiosity; it encompasses crucial scientific inquiries into adaptation, ecology, evolution, and conservation. As researchers seek to uncover the secrets held by these extraordinary organisms, the answers they find may have profound implications not only for our understanding of plant biology but also for the preservation of fragile ecosystems.

One Victim’s Father Looks Beyond Guns
After his daughter’s death in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, Joseph Samaha grew weary of empty political promises on gun control legislation and sought a middle ground to promote safer campuses.
21;22 - I was on the treadmill - as I say - in Richmond for two years - talking about sensible gun laws. I see dads on tv every day and I go - that was me - after 2 years I became frustrated - I saw the disingenuous arguments. I saw there was no traction. I had to find an alternative.

 05;00 - in april 16, 2007 - I lost my daughter reema - she was shot in French class along with 10 other students- there were 5 that were wounded as well. She was an 18 year old freshman who had declared her major in urban planning and French as a minor and that’s why she was at French class that day.

34;05 - to understand the shooters - perpetrators in general. there’s a history - there’s always a history that somebody knows about. It’s not like something that they just popped out of the egg and started killing people. There’s a pattern - and as a foundation - we’re aware of those patterns and we see it in every tragedy.

34;47 - and  we’re always going - let’s get beyond the numbers which seem to escalate every time. And it’s so traumatic - its retraumatization - especially how the Oregon shooting took place from classroom to classroom- and you go - video rewind to Virginia tech - but it is - the pattern which is more important. Which is the science of it. Now that we know the issues - what’s the science behind prevention -  



17;51 -***18;43 - there’s a continuum - it’s the longer road - it’s the seed we have to plant. It’s the alternative to discussions going around about the gun issue - which is divisive. I think we’ve become a foundation that is not blue - not red - but purple. We’re suggesting that we have things we can apply now in higher education - like 32 national initiative - that are alternatives we can apply today and not wait for our legislators to pass laws. There’s going to be 100 laws passed to plug holes in that issue.



9;37 - what we did was recruited experts on campus initiatives across 9 different areas and we asked them to help educate the educators on campus safety today....
With that in mind we created the 32 campus initiative - and it’s a self-assessment that universities and colleges would take to see wehre they are in focus areas - among them mental health - sexual assault - campus safety.... It’s not the counseling center alone that has that responsibility. // At universities where most of these departments are siloed - best practice today as most universities are learn ing is that they have to come out of their silo


16;30 - I look at this in a personal way - and I’ll use Virginia tech as an example - there were 32 students killed at Virginia tech. in my opinion - that day there were 33 students killed at Virginia tech because that shooter could have been saved - the warning signs were there.
32;14 -I don’t know how many victims have experienced forgiveness - your heart and your mind opens up to be able to do more.

"**Title: Seeking Safer Campuses: Joseph Samaha's Journey After Tragedy**

**By: [Your Name]**

**Date: [Insert Date]**

In the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, which tragically claimed the life of his daughter, Reema Samaha, Joseph Samaha experienced a profound personal and emotional upheaval. Instead of succumbing to despair, he became a passionate advocate for change, navigating the complex landscape of gun control legislation while nurturing a desire for meaningful reform in campus safety.

**The Tragedy That Sparked a Mission**

On April 16, 2007, Reema Samaha, a vibrant 18-year-old student majoring in musical theater, was among the 32 victims tragically killed when a gunman opened fire on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. For Joseph Samaha and his family, the loss was devastating, leading to countless sleepless nights filled with pain and reflection. As he navigated through the intense grief, he found himself increasingly frustrated with the political response to gun violence in America—one that often felt hollow and insincere.

**A Weariness with Promises**

Over the years, Joseph observed the cyclical nature of gun control discussions in the political arena. Each new tragedy seemed to breed a promise of reform, yet these pledges often evaporated in the face of lobbying pressures and partisan divides. “I grew weary of the empty political promises,” Joseph recounted. “After every tragedy, we’d hear the same rhetoric—'never again'—but I wanted to see real action.”

Faced with this disappointment, Joseph shifted his focus from broad policy arguments to the practicalities of promoting safety on college campuses. His experience taught him that while legislative change was crucial, it could be slow and fraught with obstacles. Thus, he sought a more immediate and pragmatic approach.

**Building a Safer Future**

Joseph Samaha's journey led him to establish the Reema J. Samaha Foundation, dedicated to fostering safe environments for students. Through the foundation, he advocates for preventative measures, including enhanced mental health resources, emergency preparedness training, and greater emphasis on conflict resolution strategies within university settings. His model emphasizes collaboration among students, faculty, and local law enforcement to create a culturally aware and responsive campus climate.

One of the key initiatives of the foundation is the promotion of ""safe space"" protocols, encouraging institutions to devise comprehensive strategies to respond swiftly to emergencies. Joseph recognizes that while the issues surrounding gun violence are complex, taking proactive steps at the grassroots level can foster a culture of safety and awareness.

**Finding Common Ground**

While Joseph remains a staunch advocate for responsible gun legislation, he also understands the importance of finding common ground. Emphasizing dialogue over division, he often engages in conversations with various stakeholders—gun owners, lawmakers, and fellow advocates—aiming to cultivate an inclusive approach to gun safety. “We can have intelligent discussions about gun rights while still advocating for sensible measures to protect our kids,” he asserts.

His efforts resonate within a broader narrative of growing concern over campus safety. With increasing calls for action from students and parents alike, Joseph's work underscores the necessity of addressing both the symptoms and root causes of gun violence in educational institutions.

**A Legacy of Hope**

Through his tireless advocacy, Joseph Samaha honors the memory of his daughter, transforming his grief into a powerful force for change. His journey serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable loss. By bridging the gap between passionate advocacy and practical solutions, Joseph exemplifies how one can promote a legacy of hope, aiming to ensure that no other parent experiences the heartbreak he has endured.

In a time marked by increasing polarization around issues of gun control, Joseph Samaha stands as a testament to the possibility of unity—a guiding light for those who seek to create safer campuses and a more just society for future generations.

"# Life After Bankruptcy: Detroit's Young Voices Rise

## By [Your Name]  
### October 15, 2023

**Detroit, MI** — A decade after the city's bankruptcy ignited a media frenzy, attention has largely shifted away from the Motor City. Once the epicenter of American industrial might, Detroit has wrestled with the consequences of economic decline, population loss, and the complexities of revival. Yet, amid the backdrop of struggle and hope, five high school students are carving out their paths, navigating a future shaped by a city still finding its footing.

### Understanding the Landscape

In July 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to declare bankruptcy, burdened by a staggering $18 billion debt. The fallout was immediate and profound: schools shuttered, public services dwindled, and residents were left grappling with uncertainty. Fast forward to today, and while some corporations and real estate developers have begun investing in the city, many neighborhoods remain riddled with poverty and underfunded schools.

Despite these challenges, the spirit of Detroit's youth has not been stifled. Five high school seniors from various corners of the city are proving that resilience is not only possible but can lead to unexpected triumphs.

### The Students' Stories

#### 1. **Alexis Johnson, 17**

Living in a neighborhood still facing the scars of the city's economic collapse, Alexis has taken on the role of a community leader. As president of her school's student council, she has initiated several community service projects, including a collaboration to clean up streets and distribute food to local families in need. “I want to show that we can create change, even if the circumstances aren’t perfect,” she says. Alexis dreams of becoming an urban planner, hoping to help revitalize Detroit's struggling areas.

#### 2. **David Kim, 18**

David, a first-generation Korean American, has found creative outlets through digital media. Amidst shuttered businesses and vacant lots, he launched a YouTube channel that highlights Detroit's hidden gems — from art installations to local cuisine. “We have to showcase the beauty here,” he states. His enchanting videos have gained traction, connecting him to a broader audience, and earned him a scholarship to a prestigious film school. 

#### 3. **Nia Roberts, 17**

Nia’s story is one of art and activism. After witnessing local injustices, she took to painting vibrant murals advocating for social change. “Art is a way to express what we feel and what we want to change,” Nia explains. Her murals have not only adorned walls across the city but also sparked conversations on social issues. Recently, she secured an internship with a nonprofit organization focused on youth empowerment, allowing her to expand her reach further.

#### 4. **Jordan Smith, 16**

Juggling academics and part-time work, Jordan has a passion for technology. He actively participates in STEM programs aimed at underprivileged youth, fostering a community of innovation. Recently recognized at a local hackathon, Jordan's team developed an app to assist residents in finding jobs and resources. “Technology is our future,” he asserts. With dreams of becoming a software engineer, he believes Detroit's resurgence hinges on tech innovation.

#### 5. **Fatima Ali, 18**

Fatima embodies resilience, having personally faced obstacles in the wake of her family’s financial struggles. A gifted singer, she uses her music to tell stories of her community. Recently chosen to perform at a cultural festival, she seized the moment to highlight local issues through her lyrics. “Music connects people, and I want to inspire others with my story,” she says, eyeing a future in music therapy to aid others facing emotional hardships.

### The Road Ahead

For these five high school seniors, life in post-bankruptcy Detroit is not defined solely by the city's struggles but by their determination to forge their own narratives. As they pursue their dreams, their stories reflect the broader aspirations of a city poised for revival. 

### Conclusion

While national attention on Detroit may have waned, the voices of the youth continue to resonate. These students are not just products of their environment; they are its architects. As the city strives to reclaim its identity, stories of resilience and hope emerge, reminding us that Detroit's future might just be in the hands of its young inhabitants. 

As Alexis, David, Nia, Jordan, and Fatima navigate their lives, they embody a spirit of tenacity that may very well lead to the Motor City’s most remarkable comeback yet.

**Plainfield, Mass.** — When museum directors Stephanie Stebich and Anne-Imelda Radice first crossed paths, the vast distance between their lives—about 2,400 miles—seemed insurmountable. Stebich led the Smithsonian’s American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., while Radice served as executive director of the New Jersey State Museum.

Their initial interactions quickly blossomed into a deep emotional connection, characterized by shared interests in the preservation of cultural heritage and a commitment to enriching community engagement through the arts.

The couple's vows highlighted the dedication and empathy they have both exhibited in their roles as museum leaders. They spoke of mutual respect, support, and the excitement of building a life together, regardless of the distance they once faced.

**A New Beginning**

As they begin this new journey together, Stebich and Radice aim to continue their work in the field of art and culture, supporting initiatives that promote inclusivity, diversity, and education. Their marriage not only marks the merging of two hearts but also serves as a poignant reminder that love can indeed flourish against all odds, breaking barriers of distance and convention.

In an exclusive interview, Stebich expressed her hope for the future: “Our relationship has always been about bridging gaps—between institutions, communities, and now, our lives. Together, we want to create a legacy that reflects our love for each other and our commitment to the arts.”

Ted Cruz Finds Support for His Opposition to Corn Subsidies
Sometimes, it’s as critical what your friends say as your enemies.
Senator Ted Cruz, already under attack in Iowa for opposing government support for ethanol, has won the support of an out-of-state conservative leader, Ken Cuccinelli II, who on Tuesday aimed an unusually blistering
                                                attack on “Big Corn” in Iowa.
“The Governor of Iowa is a Big Corn cheerleader, and his son is running a super PAC hitting Cruz for not bowing to worship Big Corn. Tsk, tsk,’’ wrote Mr. Cuccinelli, the former attorney
                                                general of Virginia.
He described an agricultural forum in Iowa early in the year attended by presidential hopefuls as a “Big corn kiss up confab.’’
Mr. Cruz is leading Iowa polls of likely Republican caucus-goers despite opposing federal support of ethanol, a major Iowa industry, which he calls corporate welfare and a distortion of the free market. The
                                                ethanol industry has paid for tough anti-Cruz radio and TV ads in Iowa, which accuse the Texas senator of hypocrisy for backing tax breaks for oil and gas drillers, an important issue in his home state.
The group run by Eric Branstad aims to make support for the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal mandate that ethanol be blended into gasoline, a litmus test for candidates in the Feb. 1 caucuses.
Every Republican caucus winner in the last quarter-century has been a strong ethanol supporter. But Mr. Cruz’s polling lead suggests the industry’s popular and political clout may be ebbing. Mr.
                                                Cruz has never tried to play down his call to end the fuel standard, unlike some rivals.
Still, it may not be to his advantage to have supporters like Mr. Cuccinelli waving a red cape at an iconic Iowa industry.
“Suddenly, the special interests are facing the real possibility that their gravy train could get derailed,’’ Mr. Cuccinelli writes. “How? If Senator Ted Cruz becomes President Ted
                                                Cruz, that’s how.’’
Federal subsidies for corn, he adds, in what he calls a paraphrase of Mr. Cruz, are “bad for the environment, bad for food prices, bad for America, and are corrupting our politics.’’

"**Title: Ted Cruz Gains Support from Ken Cuccinelli Amid Iowa Ethanol Controversy**

**By: [Your Name]**  
**Date: [Insert Date]**

In a political landscape often marked by swift changes in allegiances and opinions, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has recently solidified his support from a prominent out-of-state conservative leader, Ken Cuccinelli II. This endorsement comes at a critical time for Cruz, who is facing backlash in Iowa over his opposition to government support for ethanol—a key issue in a state heavily reliant on corn production.

**The Controversy Over Ethanol Support**

Ethanol, a biofuel derived primarily from corn, has been a cornerstone of agricultural policy in Iowa for decades. The state's economy is substantially boosted by the ethanol industry, which many local farmers and businesses rely on. Cruz’s stance against federal ethanol subsidies has sparked outrage among local farmers and agricultural advocates, who argue that such policies are vital for sustaining the state's economy and promoting renewable energy initiatives.

Cruz has articulated a vision prioritizing free-market principles, contending that government intervention distorts the market and adversely affects the economy. However, this position has left him vulnerable in the critical early voting state, where agricultural issues often dominate the political discourse. Some Iowa farmers have publicly criticized Cruz, feeling that his policies could undermine their livelihoods.

**Cuccinelli’s Endorsement**

In a calculated move to bolster Cruz's conservative credentials, Ken Cuccinelli II, former Virginia Attorney General and a prominent figure in right-wing circles, has publicly endorsed Cruz. Cuccinelli, known for his strong conservative values and significant influence among the Tea Party movement, praised Cruz as a principled leader unafraid to challenge the political establishment.

“Senator Cruz has the courage to stand up for the principles that make America great,” stated Cuccinelli in a recent press conference. “While the Iowa farming community may raise concerns about ethanol, it’s important to focus on broader economic policies that benefit all Americans, not just one segment of the industry.”

Cuccinelli’s endorsement aims to rally conservative voters who resonate with the anti-establishment narrative that Cruz embodies. As the Iowa caucuses approach, securing endorsements from influential figures like Cuccinelli may help Cruz regain support among grassroots conservatives who are wary of establishment candidates.

**The Road Ahead for Cruz**

As Cruz navigates the fallout from his ethanol stance, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Cuccinelli's endorsement can help mitigate the damage among Iowa voters. The senator is set to intensify his campaign efforts in Iowa, focusing on rallying support from conservatives who prioritize limited government, fiscal responsibility, and free market principles over specific agricultural policies.

Political analysts suggest that Cruz’s ability to articulate a cohesive message that connects his broader economic vision to the concerns of Iowa's farming community could be pivotal in his quest for the Republican nomination. It remains to be seen whether Cuccinelli's backing will turn the tide in Cruz's favor or further alienate voters who prioritize local economic interests.

**Conclusion**

The political dynamics in Iowa are shifting as Ted Cruz finds himself at a crossroads, facing both criticism over his ethanol policy and a significant endorsement from Ken Cuccinelli II. As the caucus date approaches, Cruz will need to balance his national conservative message with the local realities of Iowa's economy. Whether he can successfully reconcile these two elements will be a key determining factor in his political future as the Republican primary race intensifies.

At one point, I crouched under the cymbals to capture Ari Hoenig’sfreewheeling drum solo: “That solo was me getting back to totally normal,” he told me. “Now, am I gonna go around licking subway poles and that kind of stuff? Yes, absolutely. I’m all in.”

"# In the West Indies, an Indian Flatbread Takes Center Stage in Grab-and-Go Lunches

## The Cultural Intersection of Flavor and Convenience

### By [Your Name]  
*October 24, 2023*

The sun-drenched streets of the West Indies are alive with the vibrant colors and tantalizing aromas of local cuisine. Among the bustling markets and roadside food stalls, an unexpected culinary delight has emerged as a centerpiece for many seeking a quick and satisfying lunch: Indian flatbread, commonly known as roti. This simple yet versatile dish has transcended borders, marrying the rich flavors of Indian cooking with Caribbean influences, creating a new grab-and-go phenomenon.

### A Global Journey 

Roti has long been a staple in Indian cuisine, an unleavened bread made from whole wheat flour. Its journey to the Caribbean began with the arrival of indentured laborers from India in the 19th century, who brought with them not only their work ethic but also their culinary traditions. Over time, the flatbread adapted to its new environment, evolving into a beloved Caribbean food item, especially in countries like Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.

### The Roti Revolution

Today, roti is not just a relic of the past; it is a vibrant part of contemporary grab-and-go culture. Vendors across the West Indies have embraced this flatbread, offering it filled with an array of ingredients that celebrate local flavors. From curried chicken and lentils to spicy vegetables and seafood, the options are as diverse as the people who consume them. This rapid evolution caters to modern lifestyles, where convenience is paramount, making it easy for locals and tourists alike to enjoy a meal on the move.

### The Appeal of Roti

The allure of roti lies not only in its adaptability but also in its comforting appeal. A typical West Indian roti is soft, pliable, and warm, providing a perfect vessel for flavorful fillings. Street vendors often wrap the flatbread around savory stews or curries, offering a delightful combination of flavors and textures that satisfies the appetite. The ease with which it can be held and eaten while walking makes it an ideal lunch option for those on the go.

### A Community Staple

In the West Indies, roti shops and food stalls have become community hubs, places where friends gather, and families bond over shared meals. Many vendors have been in business for generations, passing down recipes and cooking techniques that speak to their heritage. This cultural continuity fosters a sense of identity while simultaneously allowing for innovation and adaptation. 

### Embracing Modern Trends

With a growing awareness of health and sustainability, many vendors have begun sourcing local, organic ingredients. This shift not only enhances the quality of their offerings but also supports local economies. Consumers increasingly seek out meals that reflect their values, making roti an attractive option for the health-conscious grab-and-go diner.

### Conclusion

As the sun sets over the Caribbean, the enticing scent of freshly made roti fills the air, drawing in hungry patrons. In a fast-paced world where convenience often overshadows quality, this Indian flatbread stands out as a nourishing and delicious choice. An emblem of cultural fusion and community spirit, roti embodies the flavors of the West Indies while connecting its origins to a broader global narrative. In this culinary landscape, a simple flatbread has become so much more than just a meal—it is a symbol of resilience, adaptability, and shared heritage, making it the quintessential grab-and-go lunch of the region.

"**Title:** The Supreme Court Faces Trump's Travel Ban: Can His Tweets Undermine His Case?

**By:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Location:** Washington D.C.

**Introduction**

The Supreme Court is preparing to hear one of the most contentious cases of its term: President Donald Trump's travel ban affecting individuals from six predominantly Muslim countries. This case, which has sparked widespread debate about immigration, national security, and religious discrimination, could have significant implications for the executive branch's authority. However, legal experts assert that Trump's own social media activity, particularly his tweets, may inadvertently jeopardize the administration's position in court.

**Background of the Case**

In September 2017, President Trump announced a travel ban that targeted individuals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and Sudan. The administration argued that the ban was necessary for national security and public safety, citing concerns over terrorism. However, the ban quickly faced multiple legal challenges, with opponents arguing that it was rooted in religious discrimination, violating the First Amendment rights of Muslims.

After several iterations of the ban, the case reached the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear arguments on whether the travel ban is constitutional. The court's decision could define the limits of presidential powers in matters of immigration and national security.

**The Role of Social Media**

Legal experts point to Trump's frequent use of Twitter as a potential liability for his administration's case. President Trump has been known to use the platform to express personal opinions and policy positions, often in striking and controversial ways. These tweets, some argue, may be used by opponents to support their claims that the travel ban is driven by prejudicial intentions rather than genuine concerns for national safety.

For example, Trump's past tweets, which have included statements about excluding Muslims from entering the United States, may be interpreted as evidence that the ban discriminates against Muslims based on their religion. Legal analysts highlight that the justices may take these public pronouncements into account, as they weigh the arguments presented in court.

**Expert Opinions**

Several legal experts emphasize the significance of the president's tweets. ""Social media has become part of the record in these cases,"" said Martin Lederman, a law professor at Georgetown University. ""Trump's statements often contradict the official legal rationale provided by his administration, which could fragment their arguments in the eyes of the Court.""

Another expert, Ayesha Khan, who specializes in constitutional law, described the potential impact of Trump's tweets as ""unprecedented."" ""In prior cases, justices have looked at the broader context of comments made by public officials. Trump's candid and often impulsive Twitter presence poses unique challenges to his legal team,"" she explained.

**Past Legal Precedents**

The Supreme Court has previously ruled on cases involving immigration and executive authority. In *Klein v. United States* and *National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.*, the court upheld the president's powers to regulate immigration while also reinforcing limitations tied to constitutional rights.

In 2018, the Court upheld a narrower travel ban in *Trump v. Hawaii*, but dissenting justices noted concerns regarding its constitutionality based on Trump's comments. This history suggests that the justices could once again consider whether Trump's public statements align with his administration's claims of national security.

**Conclusion**

As the Supreme Court prepares to review Trump's travel ban, the stakes are high for both the administration and its opponents. Legal experts caution that President Trump's extensive tweeting could undermine his case, bringing into question the motivations behind the ban. The justices must weigh the implications of Trump's statements against the backdrop of legal precedent, a challenge that may reshape the contours of executive authority and the future of American immigration policy.

"### U.S. Military Responds to North Korea's Missile Tests with Advanced Antimissile System Deployment

**By [Author Name]**  
**Date: [Insert Date]**  

**Osan Airbase, South Korea** — In a strategic move to bolster regional security, the United States has commenced the installation of an advanced antimissile system in South Korea following North Korea's recent missile tests. This decision comes in response to North Korea's launch of four ballistic missiles on Monday, an act that has heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

The deployment of the system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), is part of the U.S. military's ongoing efforts to protect its allies and deter aggressive actions in the region. Initial reports inaccurately stated that the equipment had been delivered to Yongsan Garrison; however, the advanced antimissile system has arrived at Osan Airbase, which serves as a primary operational base for U.S. forces in South Korea.

#### Context of the Missile Tests

On Monday morning, North Korea conducted tests that involved the firing of four ballistic missiles, underscoring its ongoing development and enhancement of military capabilities. Analysts view these actions as part of North Korea’s broader strategy to advance its missile technology and assert its military presence in the region.

In response, the U.S. military has emphasized the importance of a robust defense network to protect against potential threats posed by Pyongyang's missile program. The THAAD system is designed to intercept and destroy incoming missiles during their terminal flight phase, providing a critical layer of defense for South Korea and U.S. forces stationed there.

#### International Reactions

The international community has reacted with concern to North Korea's missile tests. The United Nations and various countries have reiterated calls for Pyongyang to cease its provocative actions. Meanwhile, China and Russia have expressed opposition to the deployment of THAAD, arguing that it disrupts the regional security balance and escalates tensions.

The U.S. remains committed to its defense obligations to South Korea, emphasizing that the installation of the antimissile system is a defensive measure intended to deter North Korean aggression. American officials have reiterated their calls for dialogue and diplomacy, while also indicating that they will respond firmly to any threats.

#### Clarification on Deployment Location

In previous communications, incorrect information regarding the specific location of THAAD's deployment was disseminated. It is crucial to clarify that the military equipment is being set up at Osan Airbase, as opposed to Yongsan Garrison, which has been a site of significant military activity but is not the current operational base for this deployment.

As the situation develops, U.S. officials are monitoring North Korean activities closely, and further deployments of military resources have not been ruled out.

#### Conclusion

The deployment of the THAAD system at Osan Airbase signals a significant step in the United States’ commitment to defending its allies in the face of evolving threats from North Korea. As the region navigates these turbulent times, both military readiness and diplomatic channels will remain of utmost importance in addressing ongoing challenges.

For further updates and analysis on this developing story, stay tuned to The New York Times.

**Correction Notice:** An earlier version of this article misidentified the military base at which the antimissile system was installed. The equipment has arrived at Osan Airbase, not Yongsan Garrison.

Alpine Is Trying, It Really Is, to Win in Formula 1
The team keeps making changes, to its cars and to its team, but continues to struggle.
ByPhillip Horton
It has been a terrible start to the season for the BWT Alpine F1 Team.
Alpine has not scored a point and has been uncompetitive at every Grand Prix, consistently finishing at the bottom of the pack.
“Unfortunately the car isn’t well born, and it’s just what it is,”Pierre Gasly,one of the team’s drivers, said at the Australian Grand Prix in late March.
It is the lowest point for a team that has underperformed for years.
Alpine, rebranded in 2021 from Renault’s Formula 1 team, had a good showing the next year, finishing fourth in the championship. It fell to sixth in 2023, with 120 points, down from 173 in 2022, and now sits at ninth. The team’s highest finish this year was 11th, in China.
Alpine had a management shake-up in 2023, andBruno Famin,previously the executive director of Alpine’s engine division, became the new team principal.
“My first impression when I joined the team was that we needed to make some quite big changes to make the team work better,” he said in an interview in April.
Alpine’s new A524 car — the development of which began before Famin’s appointment — was completely redesigned. Among major architectural changes was a new rear suspension; a more intricate floor design, a part of the car crucial for lap times; and a revised front wing. At the car’s introduction in February, Alpine said just the steering wheel was retained from the previous car.",human,"Alpine Is Trying, It Really Is, to Win in Formula 1"
"**Title: Alpine’s Determined Push for Formula 1 Success: A Strategic Rebuilding Journey**

**By [Your Name] | [Date]**

In the high-octane world of Formula 1, success is not merely measured in points, podiums, or victories; it’s a complex tapestry of engineering prowess, strategic marketing, and relentless ambition. One team that has captured the attention of fans and critics alike as it navigates the challenging waters of this elite motorsport is Alpine F1 Team. With a series of strategic moves and a clear vision for the future, Alpine is striving to not just compete but to ascend to the upper echelons of Formula 1.

**1. A New Era Begins**

Alpine, the rebranded form of Renault F1, entered the 2021 season with renewed vigor, embracing a fresh identity that reflects its heritage and aims. The name change symbolized a commitment to innovation, race performance, and a stronger brand presence. The team has since invested heavily in both technology and personnel, all with an eye on becoming a formidable competitor.

**2. Engineering Excellence: The Heart of the Strategy**

At the heart of Alpine’s quest for success lies a commitment to engineering excellence. The team has made significant investments in its chassis design and power unit, seeking to bridge the performance gap that has long separated it from the front-runners. In the competitive arena of Formula 1, a superior car is often the difference between a good season and a great one. 

With the promising talents of their driver lineup, including the experienced Fernando Alonso and the up-and-coming Esteban Ocon, Alpine is working to create a harmonious balance between driver skill and technological performance. The 2023 season has seen notable improvements in performance metrics, culminating in a series of competitive finishes that hint at a brighter future.

**3. Youth and Talent Development: Building for Tomorrow**

Youth development has become a focal point for Alpine. With an eye on long-term success, the team has launched initiatives aimed at nurturing young talent. The Alpine Academy, designed to scout and train promising drivers, has already begun to pay dividends, supplying the team with fresh talent ready to compete at the Formula 1 level.

Esteban Ocon’s development into a consistently competitive driver exemplifies the academy's success. Furthermore, the team’s commitment to promoting diversity within motorsport sets a precedent for inclusivity in a sport often criticized for its lack of representation.

**4. Strategic Partnerships and Sponsorships**

Formula 1 is as much about business as it is about racing. Recognizing this, Alpine has aggressively sought partnerships and sponsorship deals to bolster its financial stability. Recent collaborations have not only enhanced its budget but also its technological capabilities through shared resources and expertise. This strategic approach significantly contributes to the team's ability to invest in research and development.

The team is also leveraging its status as a manufacturer to attract sponsorships aligned with the Alpine brand, helping to enhance its visibility both on and off the track.

**5. The Road Ahead: Realistic Goals and Ambition**

While Alpine has made strides toward competitiveness, the road ahead remains arduous. The top-tier teams, such as Mercedes and Red Bull Racing, continue to dominate, and Alpine must maintain its upward trajectory. The goal for the upcoming seasons is clear: consistent points finishes, increasing podium appearances, and ultimately, a championship challenge.

Fans and analysts remain cautiously optimistic, recognizing the potential within the team while remaining aware of the fierce competition in Formula 1. The team’s resilience and strategic planning offer a glimmer of hope that the Alpine name will become synonymous with success in the world of motorsport.

**Conclusion: A Team on the Rise**

Alpine is trying, it really is, to carve out a significant space for itself in the prestigious realm of Formula 1. Their commitment to innovation, emphasis on young talent, and strategic business acumen are paving the way for a brighter future. As the team continues to evolve, motorsport enthusiasts are watching closely, ready to cheer for what promises to be an exciting evolution in the coming seasons. 

As Alpine pushes forward, its journey reminds us that in Formula 1, determination, strategic vision, and passion can drive a team not just to compete, but to triumph.

SATURDAY PUZZLE—Roland Huget is back, and he says below that he might have filled his puzzle differently these days, compared with how he filled it when it was submitted. That’s
                                        reasonable. We all evolve over time. And at least Mr. Huget can claim to be the guy who first introduced BARE IT ALL in The New York Times crossword.
There is some less-than-desirable fill here, like ENOL, TALCUMS and ECH,but there is also some really good fill, like SILENT
                                        TREATMENT, I’LL BE THERE (I defy you to fill that in without humming), NO SIREE BOB, CRIME SCENE, MENNONITE, PETER FALK, THE HEIRESS (great movie!), ARMWRESTLE, HERE AND NOW and I LOVE L.A. I enjoyed filling
                                        in JASMINE, but had never heard of it referred to as the name of a color. I drink JASMINE tea, though and, come to think of it, it is sort of a pale yellow. Live and learn.
There was a lot of good cluing in today’s puzzle, but the one that nearly made me do a spit take was 38 Across’s “Bush native to the South,” for JEB. It just sits there so quietly, waiting
                                        to be discovered, and of all the ways to clue JEB, that misdirection is the last way I would have expected to see it. Very clever.
Let’s check in with Mr. Huget:
Constructor’s Notes
This is my third crossword in The New York Times. From now on, I’ll stop keeping count in the constructor notes.
The crossword we see before us is actually the third version that was submitted using this grid skeleton. I recall several aborted attempts at this grid before I completed a fill that I felt comfortable in submitting,
                                            in the summer of 2013. It was rejected, and from that effort only HERE AND NOW made its way into the final version, although not in the same word slot. The second version was submitted in late 2013, just when
                                            I was starting to get the hang of crossword construction. It too was rejected, but the top and bottom stacks and the vertical SILENT TREATMENT got a thumbs-up. The final version, incorporating these elements,
                                            was completed in June of 2014, and was accepted for publication in September of that year.
It’s interesting to revisit an early construction that one hasn’t seen in a while. Thankfully, there aren’t any entries here that make me cringe, but my style definitely has changed since this
                                            puzzle was produced. More than I realized, this puzzle is tailored to the over-50 crowd. I hope younger solvers aren’t put off by that.
My favorite clues are 26A: MENNONITE: [One speaking the language Plautdietsch] and 56A: ARM WRESTLE: [Try to win hands down?]. I can’t claim credit for either.

Hurry
This is how winter passes.The baby plays with a mirror.There’s nothing outside he knows.Branches open in the hedge.People drive long distances.The world’s face is halfin shadow, like his.He wakes, is fed, sleeps again.Outside rages and deepens.In the mirror, the baby returnsto the two-player game, eacheach time becomingmore and less familiar.
Matthew Zapruderis the author of four poetry collections, including, most recently, “Sun Bear.” He teaches poetry at Saint Mary’s College of California and is editor at large at Wave Books.Ed Skoogis the author of three collections of poetry, including “Run the Red Lights,” which will be published by Copper Canyon Press in November.

EgyptAir Hijacking Suspect Says He Acted Out of Desperation
transcript
Hijacking Suspect to be Held 8 Days
An Egyptian man suspected of hijacking an EgyptAir flight and diverting it to Cyprus — to see his estranged family, he said — will remain in the custody of local police during the investigation.
(SOUNDBITE) (English) CYPRUS POLICE SPOKESMAN, ANDREAS AGGELIDIS, SAYING:

“The suspect presented today before the court, and he will stay in custody for eight days. So the case is under investigation and in the framework of this investigation we are going to take statements, and continue to enquiries, just to finish the whole case.”
ByKareem Fahim
LARNACA, Cyprus — Seif Eldin Mustafa, the Egyptian man who grabbed the world’s attention byhijacking an EgyptAirflightand diverting it to Cyprus, has admitted his crimes to Cypriot investigators but insisted that he acted out of desperation, prosecutors said on Wednesday during his first court appearance.
Mr. Mustafa, 59, boarded EgyptAir Flight 181 on Tuesday morning, wore a fake explosives belt and demanded that the pilot take him to Cyprus, Turkey or Greece, prosecutors said. When the plane landed in Larnaca, on the southern coast of Cyprus, Mr. Mustafa made various demands, including that a letter be delivered to his former wife, a Cypriot citizen, they said.
“When someone hasn’t seen his family for 24 years and wants to see his wife and children, and the Egyptian government won’t let him, what is he supposed to do?” Mr. Mustafa told the authorities, according to a statement by prosecutors.
Prosecutors requested that Mr. Mustafa remain in detention, arguing that if freed he might try to influence the testimony of his passengers and relatives or he might try to flee. The judge, Maria K. Loizou of Larnaca District Court, ordered that Mr. Mustafa remain in custody for eight more days. The Egyptian authorities have formally requested the extradition of Mr. Mustafa, the country’s chief prosecutor said on Wednesday.
The hijacking on Tuesday morning raised the specter of international terrorism and seemed to be another devastating blow for Egypt, which has been criticized for lax security at its airports. The mood turned to relief as Mr. Mustafa released most of the hostages, and the episode eventually gave way to dark humor, as officials characterized Mr. Mustafa as a lovelorn, if disturbed, man who insisted on seeing his former wife. A photograph showing him standing next to a grinning passenger spread rapidly on social media, contributing to the sense of levity.
But as he appeared in court on Wednesday, wearing a black jacket and looking confused and exhausted, with his hair matted and his hands shaking, nothing about the episode seemed funny to Mr. Mustafa or to the spectators. The charges prosecutors read out — including piracy and violations of counterterrorism law — carry life sentences.",human,"In a court appearance, Seif Eldin Mustafa faced numerous charges in connection with the EgyptAir flight that was diverted to Cyprus."
"**Seif Eldin Mustafa Faces Multiple Charges in Connection with EgyptAir Flight Diversion**

*Published: [Insert Date]*

*Location: Nicosia, Cyprus*

In a high-profile court appearance this week, Seif Eldin Mustafa, the man accused of hijacking an EgyptAir flight earlier this year, faced numerous charges linked to the dramatic mid-flight diversion of the aircraft to Cyprus. The case has drawn international attention, highlighting issues of aviation security and the passenger experience during crises.

**Background of the Incident**

On March 29, 2023, EgyptAir Flight MS181, which was en route from Alexandria, Egypt, to Cairo, was diverted by Mustafa, who claimed to be armed with an explosive device. The aircraft, carrying 81 people, including passengers and crew, was diverted to Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus after Mustafa allegedly threatened to detonate the device if his demands were not met. The situation prompted a full-scale response from Cyprus authorities, who worked swiftly to ensure the safety of everyone onboard.

**Charges Filed Against Mustafa**

Following the resolution of the incident, Mustafa was arrested and extradited to Cyprus to face charges. In the courtroom, prosecutors outlined multiple counts against him, including:

1. **Hijacking**: The primary charge, focusing on his unlawful seizure of the aircraft.
2. **Threatening Public Safety**: For endangering the lives of the passengers and crew during the flight.
3. **Possession of Explosive Materials**: Related to his claims of carrying explosives while on the plane.
4. **Terrorism-Related Charges**: Given the intent behind his actions and the panic caused among those onboard and at the airport.
5. **Endangering the Lives of Others**: Subsuming various acts that jeopardized the safety of passengers and crew members.

**Legal Proceedings and Next Steps**

During the court appearance, Mustafa demonstrated little emotion, speaking briefly through an interpreter to communicate with the judge. His legal team has indicated intentions to contest the charges, citing a lack of clear evidence regarding the alleged explosives and arguing that Mustafa was under severe psychological stress during the incident.

The Cypriot judge has scheduled additional hearings, allowing more time for evidence gathering and for the prosecution to build its case. Legal experts suggest that Mustafa's defense could hinge on psychiatric evaluations, potentially influencing the trajectory of his trial.

**Security Implications and Passenger Experience**

The incident has sparked discussions about airport security protocols and the safety of passengers during international flights. Aviation experts emphasize that such hijackings, although relatively rare, underscore the need for enhanced security measures and effective crisis management strategies to mitigate risks.

In the aftermath of the diversion, all passengers were unharmed and safely evacuated, thanks to coordinated efforts by the Cypriot authorities and airport personnel. However, the psychological impact on those onboard and the broader implications for air travel security remain ongoing concerns.

As the legal proceedings continue, the case of Seif Eldin Mustafa serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities faced within civil aviation and the critical importance of maintaining robust safety measures to protect both passengers and crew in an increasingly complex global landscape.

Analysis From Our Reporters
The first round of results from Nevada are finally in. Adam Laxalt, the Trump-endorsed candidate for Senate, has a comfortable early lead. If he wins, he will face Catherine Cortez-Masto, one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators, this fall.
Mayra Flores, a Republican, has won the special election in Texas to replace former Representative Filemon Vela in a Hispanic-majority district in the Rio Grande Valley. Flores will be the first Republican from the district and the first Latina Republican from Texas in Congress.
With just over 25 percent of precincts reporting, it’s looking like a steeper hill to climb for Tom Rice to make it to a runoff. He’s trailing his primary challenger Russell Fry by 20 points. Fry has 45 percent of the vote.
Gov. Janet T. Mills of Maine, a Democrat, and Paul LePage, a Republican, advanced to the general election for governor. Both were uncontested. LePage was governor from 2011 to 2019, when he was succeeded by Mills.
Early returns from Charleston County look good for Representative Nancy Mace, the Republican competing with a Trump-endorsed challenger, Katie Arrington. But no results are in from Beaufort County on the state’s south coast — Arrington’s stronghold.
In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, voters are casting ballots in a special election to replace Representative Filemon Vela, a Democrat. Republicans are aggressively courting voters in the heavily Hispanic district, but the winner will only hold office until January.
In Nevada’s sprawling Fourth Congressional District, Republicans are vying to take on Representative Steven Horsford. One of the top G.O.P. candidates, Sam Peters, has the backing of some of the most far-right Republicans in the House, like Representatives Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona.

As New Yorkers head to the polls to choose their mayoral candidates, it’s a good time to revisit chapters from the city’s past.
We recommend some noteworthy biographies of the city’s mayors, from La Guardia to Bloomberg →
There’s No One Like a New York Mayor

"**As New Yorkers Head to the Polls, Revisiting the City’s Political History**

*By [Your Name]*  
*October 2023*

As New Yorkers prepare to cast their votes in the upcoming mayoral primary, it’s an opportune moment to reflect on the city’s rich political history. The choices voters face today are rooted in a tapestry woven from decades of political turmoil, visionary leadership, and transformative policies that have shaped the very fabric of New York City.

### A Legacy of Leadership

New York City’s history is replete with dynamic figures who have wielded the mantle of leadership with varying degrees of effectiveness and innovation. From Fiorello La Guardia’s galvanizing leadership during the Great Depression to Ed Koch’s brash charm in the 1980s, each mayor has left a distinct mark on the city.

La Guardia, often remembered for his charismatic and no-nonsense approach, made significant strides in immigration reform and labor relations. His efforts to bridge communities during a time of profound economic strife set a precedent for future leaders in the city. Koch, on the other hand, confronted the fiscal crisis of the 1970s head-on, famously declaring, “The Bronx is burning,” a phrase that encapsulated both the struggles and resilience of the city.

### The Shadow of Corruption

Every chapter in New York's political saga has not been marked by success. The city has battled pervasive corruption, exemplified by figures like James J. Walker, whose tenure in the 1920s was marred by scandal and eventual resignation. His downfall, amidst accusations of graft and misuse of office, serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked power and the importance of transparency in governance.

In the late 20th century, the political climate began to shift as reform movements gained momentum. Activist organizations emerged, pushing for greater accountability and ethical standards among elected officials. This call for reform would resonate deeply in the 21st century, especially in the wake of high-profile corruption scandals that plagued various administrations.

### Social Change and Urban Policy

The evolution of New York City’s social policies is another crucial chapter in its history. The rise of the civil rights movement in the 1960s propelled issues of race, equity, and justice to the forefront of political discourse. Mayors like David Dinkins pushed for inclusive policies aimed at addressing systemic inequities, although he faced significant challenges in a divided city.

In contrast, Rudy Giuliani’s tenure in the late 1990s marked a pivot towards tough-on-crime policies, which, while credited with reducing crime rates, also sparked debates about racial profiling and police brutality. The city’s recent reckoning with these issues, particularly in light of movements like Black Lives Matter, underscores the ongoing relevance of historical decisions in shaping current policies and public sentiment.

### The Future of New York City

As voters head to the polls for the mayoral primaries, they are not just selecting candidates; they are choosing the direction of New York City’s future. The echoes of past mayors resonate through the debates about housing, public safety, education, and economic recovery from the pandemic. Urban challenges that once seemed insurmountable remain at the forefront, urging candidates to build on or diverge from legacies that have come before them.

### Conclusion

In casting their ballots, New Yorkers are invited not just to engage with the present but to reflect on the lessons of the past. Each election serves as a reminder of the responsibilities that come with leadership and the enduring call for progress amidst the complexities of urban life. As candidates campaign and communities rally, the stories of yesteryear remind us that every vote is a step along a historical continuum, shaping the vibrant metropolis that is New York City.

"**Ted Cruz Visits Goldfield: A Glimpse into Small-Town America**

*Goldfield, Iowa — In a rare visit to rural America, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas arrived in the small town of Goldfield on Wednesday, a community of just 635 residents. Emphasizing the importance of family, Cruz shared anecdotes about his two young daughters during his speech, aiming to resonate with the town’s values of family and hard work.*

The backdrop of Goldfield, characterized by its sparse landscape and close-knit community, offered a stark contrast to the bustling halls of Congress that Cruz typically inhabits. His appearance was part of a broader effort to connect with voters in less urbanized areas as he gears up for potential 2024 presidential aspirations.

**Local Engagement and Family Values**

Standing before a modest crowd gathered in the town’s community center, Cruz opened his remarks by invoking his daughters’ names and their playful antics, attempting to bridge the gap between his role as a senator and his life as a father. “In my house, we have a lot more giggles than serious debates,” Cruz quipped, eliciting smiles from the attendees.

While discussing the importance of family, Cruz touched on the challenges facing small towns, emphasizing the need for economic revitalization and support for local businesses. Residents nodded in agreement, appreciative of a voice that highlighted their struggles and aspirations.

**A Joke That Missed the Mark**

In an effort to lighten the mood and engage his audience, Cruz recited a joke from the iconic comedian Henny Youngman: “Take my wife…please!” Unfortunately, the punchline landed flat, leaving the crowd in an awkward silence. The misfire highlighted the difficulties politicians often face when trying to connect humorously, especially in a place like Goldfield, where traditional values run deep.

Cruz quickly pivoted, laughing off the moment with self-deprecation. “Well, humor is subjective, isn’t it?” he remarked, garnering a few reluctant chuckles. His ability to navigate the hiccup demonstrated his experience in public speaking, even if the intended light-heartedness didn’t quite resonate as planned.

**Response from Residents**

After the speech, community members expressed mixed reactions. Some appreciated Cruz’s focus on family and local issues, while others were left wanting deeper engagement on policy matters that directly impact Iowa farmers and businesses. Betty Thompson, a lifelong Goldfield resident, shared, “It’s nice to see a senator come here, but I hope they really listen to us and not just use us for photo ops.”

**Conclusion**

Senator Ted Cruz’s visit to Goldfield provided a glimpse into the unique dynamics of small-town politics and the challenges of connecting with diverse audiences. While his anecdotes about fatherhood and brief foray into comedy didn’t quite resonate with all, his presence was a reminder of the importance of grassroots engagement as the political landscape continues to evolve ahead of the next election cycle. 

As small towns like Goldfield grapple with their future, the hope remains that elected officials will not only reach out but also listen and advocate for the issues that matter most to their constituents.",ai,"Ted Cruz visited Goldfield, population 635, and spoke of his young daughters and recited a Henny Youngman joke that didn’t quite land."

"**Title: Understanding the Role of Pharmacy Benefit Managers in Healthcare**

**Byline: [Your Name] | Date: [Today's Date]**

**Introduction**

As the cost of prescription medications continues to rise, a significant player in the pharmaceutical landscape remains somewhat veiled from public scrutiny: Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). These intermediaries play a crucial role in the healthcare system, influencing the prices we pay for medications, the relationships between pharmacies and drug manufacturers, and the overall landscape of healthcare spending. This article delves into how PBMs function, their growing influence, and the implications for patients, healthcare providers, and the pharmaceutical industry.

**What Are Pharmacy Benefit Managers?**

Pharmacy Benefit Managers are third-party administrators of prescription drug programs. They negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies to manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurers and employers. Their primary responsibilities include:

1. **Negotiating Prices:** PBMs leverage their large customer base to negotiate discounts and rebates from drug manufacturers. By negotiating bulk purchasing deals, they aim to keep medication prices lower for insurers and ultimately for consumers.

2. **Formulary Management:** PBMs create and maintain formularies—lists of approved medications that are covered under insurance plans. They evaluate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of drugs to determine which medications are included and at what tier they fall, impacting out-of-pocket costs for patients.

3. **Pharmacy Networks:** PBMs establish and manage networks of pharmacies, determining which pharmacies recipients can use while still receiving benefits. They negotiate reimbursement rates and manage the relationship between pharmacies and insurers.

4. **Clinical Services:** Many PBMs offer clinical programs to help manage the prescribing of certain high-cost medications. These services can include medication therapy management, adherence programs, and utilization reviews to ensure appropriate use of drugs.

**The Influence of PBMs**

PBMs have gained significant power within the pharmaceutical supply chain, which raises several concerns:

1. **Transparency Issues:** One of the biggest criticisms of PBMs is the lack of transparency in their pricing structures and the rebates they receive. Patients often remain unaware of the true costs of their medications, as the final price is obscured by negotiations between PBMs and manufacturers.

2. **Cost Shifting:** While PBMs claim to lower drug costs, the mechanisms they use can result in cost shifting. Discounts received by PBMs do not always translate into lower prices for consumers. Patients may still face higher out-of-pocket expenses, especially for specialty drugs or medications not favored on the formulary.

3. **Market Consolidation:** The PBM industry has seen significant consolidation, with just a few large entities dominating the market. This consolidation can limit competition and impact pricing strategies, leaving consumers with fewer choices and higher costs.

4. **Impact on Pharmacies:** Independent pharmacies often struggle to negotiate fair reimbursement rates with PBMs. As a result, many local pharmacies face financial difficulties, impacting access to medications in certain communities.

**Calls for Reform**

Given the growing concerns about the role of PBMs, lawmakers and healthcare advocates are calling for greater transparency and accountability in the industry. Some proposed reforms include:

- **Transparency Mandates:** Legislation that requires PBMs to disclose the full range of rebates and discounts they negotiate with manufacturers, ensuring that savings are passed on to consumers.

- **Regulatory Oversight:** Increased scrutiny from regulators to monitor PBM practices and ensure fair competition within the pharmaceutical supply chain.

- **Support for Independent Pharmacies:** Initiatives that promote access to community pharmacies to balance market dynamics and ensure patients have a choice in where to fill their prescriptions.

**Conclusion**

Pharmacy Benefit Managers are critical intermediaries in the healthcare system, but their influence comes with complexities and challenges that affect patients, physicians, and pharmacies alike. As the conversation continues about healthcare costs and access to medications, understanding how PBMs operate is essential for all stakeholders involved. Moving forward, greater transparency, regulatory oversight, and reform may be necessary to align the interests of PBMs with the needs of those they serve.

In the cinematic world, the union of extraordinary talent often leads to unforgettable moments on screen. Andrew Haigh, the acclaimed director known for his keen exploration of human emotions, presents a remarkable sequence from his film that encapsulates the depth of connection and complexity of relationships. This moment, featuring formidable actors Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay, not only highlights their performances but also exemplifies Haigh's signature storytelling style.

**The Scene: A Tapestry of Emotion**

The sequence in question masterfully weaves together subtlety and intensity, showcasing two characters grappling with the passage of time and the weight of memories. Set against a backdrop that feels as intimate as it is expansive, the scene unfolds in a quaint, dimly lit room, where the soft light filters through sheer curtains, casting a gentle glow on the characters' faces.

Haigh describes this pivotal moment as the emotional crux of the film. He explains how every nuance of Rampling and Courtenay's performances brings the scene to life, emphasizing the unsaid words and the delicate interplay of silence that speaks volumes. The tension is palpable, creating a space where the audience can feel the characters' unspoken longing and regret.

**Character Dynamics: Rampling and Courtenay**

Charlotte Rampling, known for her ability to convey profound depth with mere expressions, embodies a character who is both reflective and resilient. Haigh notes her talent for capturing the fragility of human experience, making the audience connect with her portrayal on an emotional level. In this scene, Rampling's character reminisces about lost opportunities and choices made, her voice a blend of strength and vulnerability.

Tom Courtenay, a veteran performer whose career spans decades, complements Rampling's dynamism with his own nuanced portrayal. His character grapples with guilt and nostalgia, embodying the weight of history between the two. Haigh highlights Courtenay's ability to convey a range of emotions with subtle gestures, making his silent moments just as impactful as the spoken dialogue.

**Cinematography and Direction**

Haigh’s directorial choices are pivotal in crafting the atmosphere of this sequence. The use of close-ups allows the viewer to delve deep into the characters’ expressions, capturing fleeting moments that reveal their innermost thoughts. The camera movement is deliberate, creating a rhythmic ebb and flow that mirrors the conversation and emotional exchange between the characters.

In an interview, Haigh shares insights into the collaborative process behind the scenes, emphasizing the trust he has in his actors. He notes that both Rampling and Courtenay brought their own interpretations to their roles, enriching the narrative texture with their life experiences and artistic instincts.

**Themes of Time and Memory**

At its core, this scene encapsulates profound themes of time and memory—hallmarks of Haigh's work. The characters' reflections serve as a meditation on how the past shapes the present, striking a chord with anyone who has grappled with the weight of their own history. As the scene unfolds, viewers are invited to confront their own memories, forging a connection that transcends the screen.

**Conclusion**

Andrew Haigh's portrayal of this scene featuring Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay is a testament to the power of cinema to evoke raw emotion and introspection. The collaboration between the director and his actors results in a moment that is not only visually striking but also rich in meaning. As audiences eagerly anticipate the film’s release, this sequence stands out as a tantalizing glimpse into the profound narrative journey that awaits them.

"# Accessories to Set the Mood for a Joyful Dinner for Newlyweds

As newlyweds embark on their journey together, creating an inviting atmosphere for shared meals can enhance their bond and foster warm memories. Here’s a curated list of accessories to help set the perfect mood for a joyful dinner at home.

## 1. Elegant Tableware

### a. Dinnerware
Start with exquisite dinnerware. Opt for a cohesive set that reflects both partners' tastes—think delicate porcelain or contemporary stoneware. This provides a foundation that enhances the visual appeal of every meal.

### b. Glassware
Invest in a set of beautiful glasses for both wine and water. Crystal or hand-blown glass can elevate the dining experience, making even a casual meal feel special.

## 2. Soft Textiles

### a. Table Linens
Introduce soft, rich tablecloths and coordinating napkins. A linen or cotton tablecloth creates a warm foundation, while cloth napkins add an element of sophistication. 

### b. Cushions
If dining on a patio or a casual setup, consider throw pillows for chairs, offering both comfort and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Ambient Lighting

### a. Candles
Nothing beats the gentle glow of candles for creating an intimate environment. Use a variety of sizes—tapered, votive, and tealights—to create depth. Consider scented candles to provide a delightful olfactory experience.

### b. String Lights
For outdoor dinners or a cozy indoor setting, string lights can add a whimsical touch. Opt for warm white lights to maintain a romantic ambiance.

## 4. Nature’s Touch

### a. Fresh Flowers
A small centerpiece of seasonal flowers can infuse life and color into your dining space without overpowering the table. Choose flowers that resonate with both partners' favorites.

### b. Potted Herbs
For a unique twist, consider using small potted herbs as centerpieces. Not only do they look beautiful, but they also provide fresh flavors for your dishes.

## 5. Personal Touches

### a. Customized Place Cards
Adding personalized place cards shows thoughtfulness and attention to detail. Use simple cardstock or handmade paper and write each guest's name, or create cards that reflect shared interests or memories.

### b. Photo Displays
Incorporate a small photo display showcasing moments from your relationship. This invites conversation and adds a personal element to the dining experience.

## 6. Thoughtful Extras

### a. Music Playlist
Curate a playlist of songs significant to your relationship. Soft instrumental music or your favorite romantic tunes can set the appropriate mood without overpowering the conversation.

### b. Themed Dinnerware
Consider themed dinnerware or serving platters that reflect special memories or shared experiences—like a porcelain dish from your honeymoon destination or locally crafted items from a vacation.

## Conclusion

Setting the mood for a joyful dinner as newlyweds involves selecting accessories that resonate with both partners' styles and preferences. By thoughtfully integrating beautiful tableware, soft textiles, ambient lighting, nature, personal touches, and extras that celebrate your journey together, this phase of your life can be blessed with intimate and cherished mealtime moments.

5.Canoe With a View, 9:30 a.m.

Sitting at wood tables under amber globe lights,you mighttry outstanding small plates like roasted chicken ceviche ($10), cornbread blood sausage ($12) and a board of tiny pastries and sweets, called the “dessert charcuterie” ($6). For a culinary trip that feels like eating a science experiment, head back to Kendall Square forCafé ArtScience. The ambience is lablike, and the food is wonderfully fussy, from smoked duck salad with foie gras “snow” ($14) to a perfect round of bison tartare ($34) to the strawberry lemongrass creamsicle ($15). The bartender’s “Le Whaf” cocktails turn liquids into breathable vapor, and the devices that hatch them, invented by a Harvard engineering professor, are also on sale.
11.Night Life and Nerdom, 9:30 p.m.
A bar hop based in grittier Central Square begins atBrick & Mortar, acocktail nookthatfeels secretive, but the drinks are city-known; try the Bootsy Collins “rum, funk, pineapple, crack” ($11). Alternatively, brave the cramped Irish pub and restaurantPlough and Stars, where patrons transition from food to live music. Then there’s the celebratedMiddle East and Zuzucomplex, whose four stages host national indie rock acts and D.J.nights. For the true local dive bar encounter, poke your head into theCantab Loungefor cover dance bands and poetry slams. Or, get your nerd on atPandemonium Books and Games, whose shelves and basement are Cambridge’smother shipfor genre books and gaming pursuits.
12.A Brunch Runs Through It, 10 a.m.
AtHarvest, a Harvard Square classic, a three-course prix fixe brunch menu ($35) recently featured dried fruit fritters, the Tom Waits Nighthawk Diner Breakfast (“eggs and sausage with a side of toast, hash browns, over easy”) and Taza Chocolate Pâté. Then work off yourmeal with a peaceful walk along the banks of the Charles River (in the warmer months, Memorial Drive is closed to traffic on Sundays).
13.Frames and Flora, 12:30 p.m.
After a $350 million rehab by Renzo Piano, Harvard’s Fogg, Busch-Reisinger and Arthur M. Sackler museums ($15), collectively known as theHarvard Art Museums, have been retooled under one roof; the spectacular collection includes works from nearly every period of art history. Another top draw is theHarvard Museum of Natural History. The gallery featuring its intricatelymadebotanical models, the “Glass Flowers,” recently reopened after an extensive refresh. The adjacentPeabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnologyis packed with giant totem poles, casts of Maya stelas and Penobscot birch bark canoes ($12 ticket admits you to both).
The Charles Hotel (1 Bennett Street; charleshotel.com; from $299) is a known haunt of Bill Clinton and Bill Gates when they come to Harvard. The rooms are classy and modern, and three restaurants, one bar, one jazz club, an outdoor bar in summer (and ice skating in winter), pool and fitness center, are all on site, making this the prime full-service home base in the heart of Harvard Square.
For a more B&B-like stay in a quieter, residential neighborhood, try the Mary Prentiss Inn (6 Prentiss Street; maryprentissinn.com; from $249), closer to Porter Square and a five minute walk to the Red Line. The gorgeously-renovated, former 1843 Greek revival home has colorful rooms furnished with four poster beds and antiques; two deluxe rooms off the garden deck have fireplaces and Jacuzzi bathtubs.

"**Title: President Trump Responds to Chemical Attack in Syria During Joint Press Conference with King Abdullah**

**Date: [Insert Date]**

**By: [Insert Author Name]**

In a poignant moment during a joint news conference with King Abdullah II of Jordan on Wednesday, President Donald Trump addressed the recent chemical attack in Syria that left numerous children dead and injured. The President expressed his strong emotional response to the tragedy, stating, “That attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me.” 

This statement marks a significant shift in Trump’s rhetoric surrounding the ongoing conflict in Syria, which has plagued the region for over a decade. Trump's emotional reaction underscores the harrowing humanitarian implications of the conflict, particularly the suffering of innocents.

**The Context of the Attack**

On Tuesday, media reports emerged detailing a horrific chemical assault allegedly carried out by Syrian government forces in the northwestern province of Idlib. Eyewitness accounts and credible reports indicated that the attack involved the use of toxic gases, leading to widespread panic and devastation, particularly among children. Health organizations reported a spike in cases of respiratory distress and other severe symptoms in the aftermath.

The implications of this recent event weigh heavily not only on regional stability but also on international relations. For the United States and its allies, the incident raises critical questions regarding the appropriate course of action, as previously established red lines regarding chemical weapons usage appear to have been crossed once again.

**Bipartisan Concerns**

Trump's emotional resonance with the assault has drawn attention across the political spectrum. Lawmakers from both parties have voiced their outrage and empathy regarding the plight of those affected. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) stated, “This is a barbaric act that cannot go unanswered,” echoing sentiments shared by many who advocate for stronger U.S. involvement in alleviating the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria.

Among Democrats, Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) highlighted the necessity for a definitive strategy in response to such atrocities, emphasizing, “Our silence in the face of these crimes can no longer be an option.”

**Next Steps and International Response**

The international community awaits the United States' next move. Trump's remarks during the news conference signal a potential reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy in Syria, especially in light of previous hesitations to intervene militarily.

King Abdullah II of Jordan, who has consistently called for more decisive action against the Syrian regime, stood alongside Trump as he stressed the importance of international cooperation in confronting such humanitarian crises. “The time for discussion is over; we must act,” remarked Abdullah, reinforcing his position on the need for cohesive global action.

**Conclusion**

As the world reacts to the harrowing consequences of the chemical attack on innocent children, President Trump’s empathetic response reflects not only a personal conviction but also a growing urgency for the United States and its allies to formulate a coherent strategy in Syria. With pressure mounting from within the U.S. and abroad, the potential for policy shifts in the coming days is palpable. The situation remains dynamic, and further developments will likely affect the course of U.S. involvement in this prolonged conflict.

Drinking With the Candidates: Entertain Your Guests With Weird Campaign Swag
Why serve your friends and family with ordinary glassware when you could be enraging them by bringing politics to the party? Whether you’re hosting an intimate brunch or a New Year’s Eve party for hundreds,
                                        this year’s presidential candidates have you covered — their online stores promise to keep your beer cold, your coffee hot and your wine whatever temperature it’s supposed to be, all while sparking
                                        the kinds of tense conversations you’ll continue to regret long after Election Day.
Below is a small sampling of the beverage containers that could enliven your next gathering with just a few keystrokes and a small contribution to a candidate’s campaign. For maximum effect, pair with a stylishChristmas sweaterfeaturing one of the candidates — after the 25th,
                                        they’re retro!
Rand Paul’swine glasses
“It’s not too late to volunteer for the Rand Paul campaign and then come home and enjoy a glass of fine American wine in a Rand Paul glass,” Mr. Paul’s website says, offering a date idea
                                        for the ages. “For the discriminating Rand Paul wine drinker, this glass is a step above.”
In an incredible disappointment, the site does not offer Rand Paul wine.
Rand Paul’sChristmas mug
This mug gives the Paul campaign a chance to get in a dig at those who were mad at Starbucks because itsnew cups weren’t Christmassy enough.
                                        “We don’t know what the big deal is about the Christmas mug at Starbucks, but here’s our Christmas mug…or Holiday mug…whatever you want to call it,” the site says. “What’s
                                        important is that every mug serves up 15 ounces of hot freedom…and who doesn’t like hot freedom!”
Whoever writes Mr. Paul’s website copy is clearly having a good time, unlike Mr. Paul.
Official“I Miss W.” mug
Are mugs that say “I Miss W.” so popular that there are unofficial knockoffs? Just to be safe, better get the official version, available at GOP.com.
G.O.P.Constitution mug
The most fun person at any gathering is the one whose mug reminds everybody that the Constitution is “still the law of the land.” For just $14, that party animal can be you.
Jeb Bush’smason jar
Not just for Brooklyn weddings anymore! This super-hip drinking jar comes with either a red lid or a blue one, if you really want to send mixed messages.
Marco Rubio’s“Freedom of Espresso” mug
This mug says “I support freedom of Espresso,” which is a little incongruous since it appears to be a coffee mug, not an espresso cup. Maybe it’s for latte-drinking liberals — or maybe the
                                        espresso is off somewhere, running free.
Marco Rubio’scoffee bundle
For just $85, you can get that “freedom of Espresso” mug with a mug that says “Wake up, America!” and a travel thermos that also says “Wake up, America!” Okay, okay, we’re
                                        getting up, we promise!
Ted Cruz’skoozie 4-pack
Ted Cruz’s website includes a variety of camouflage items, including these koozies, which will allow your beer to blend into the foliage as it stalks wild game (a gun-rights-for-beer-cans movement cannot be far
                                        off). The koozies are actually called “Cruzies,” perhaps to give the buyer the impression that Ted Cruz is fun.
Ted Cruz’s “A Very Camo Christmas” bundle
Why get just a pack of Cruzies when you can get a pack of Cruziesanda hat? The “ladies’” version of this bundle includes a pink hat, for ladies who hunt in pink forests.
“Chillary Clinton”koozies
Buy these with the“Grillary Clinton” spatulaandJeb Bush’s “guaca bowle”for an extremely absurd — but bipartisan — cookout. Still too cold for grilling where you live? Not to worry — this campaign season lasts over ten more months, so there’s time to put

"**Title: The Avant-Garde Host: Serving Politics Alongside Your Gin and Tonic**

**By [Your Name]**  
*Published: [Insert Date]*

---

In the realm of hosting, the ambiance often hinges on the subtle details—lighting, decor, and, yes, even the glassware. While some may rally behind the idea of keeping gatherings quaint and mellow with ordinary glassware, a bold trend is emerging among the avant-garde host: why not serve your friends their favorite cocktails in vessels that ignite conversation and perhaps even a little friendly debate? Enter the world of politically charged glassware—an audacious choice that promises to enrich your social gatherings and stoke the intellectual fires of your guests.

### The Situation: Ordinary Glassware Falls Flat

The traditional setup of a party—charmed by delicate wine glasses and classic tumblers—may seem safe and approachable. But in this age of polarization, where political discourse hangs over every social interaction, offering mundane glassware might just be an invitation to collective boredom. Guests come together not only to enjoy fine drinks but to grapple with the ideas and issues shaping the world today. Why serve them with uninspired glassware when you could entice them into discussing the pressing matters of our time?

### The Concept: Political Glassware as Conversation Starters

Imagine this: You pour a refreshing cocktail into a glass adorned with satirical caricatures of contemporary political figures. Or perhaps you opt for themed drinkware that meticulously features historical quotes, iconic campaign slogans, or current socio-political issues. With each sip, your guests are invited to engage—not only with the exquisite flavors of the drink but also with the imprints and ideologies represented in their glassware.

#### a. Types of Political Glassware

1. **Controversial Caricatures**: Glasses featuring playful depictions of politicians are bound to elicit reactions. Present a drink in a glass adorned with a tongue-in-cheek rendering of today's most talked-about leaders. The ensuing laughter or heated discussions can light up the room.

2. **Themed Cocktail Names**: Introduce cocktails with names inspired by current events or political jargon. For instance, serve a “Filibuster Fizz” for a refreshing lemonade spritz, making it a topic of discussion before the drink is even tasted.

3. **Message-driven Mugs**: Use mugs that boldly display progressive messages or conservative slogans. The stark contrasts offer fertile ground for spirited debate.

### The Benefits: Sparking Dialogue Over Drinks

By incorporating political glassware into your hosting toolkit, you’re not merely offering drinks; you’re creating a platform for dialogue. Here’s why you should consider this unconventional method:

- **Promotes Engagement**: Guests are more likely to share their thoughts and perspectives when presented with materials that provoke curiosity. Political glassware serves as an icebreaker, propelling discussions into meaningful territories.

- **Fosters Diverse Opinions**: A gathering is an opportunity for a spectrum of viewpoints, allowing guests to understand each other's positions while enjoying their beverages. This exchange of ideas can lead to enlightening moments that may reshape perceptions.

- **Injects Humor**: Politics can often feel heavy; laughter can lighten the mood. Political glassware that employs satire can help transform a potentially fraught conversation into an enjoyable experience.

### The Risks: Navigating Sensitive Terrain

However, it’s essential to tread carefully in this political landscape. Just as political conversations can be invigorating, they can also lead to tensions. Here are two considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Know Your Audience**: Gauge the political leanings of your guests beforehand. Offer an inclusive approach—provide options that allow everyone to feel comfortable sharing their viewpoints.

2. **Set a Respectful Tone**: As the host, your responsibility is to foster a respectful environment. Establish ground rules for discussions to ensure everyone feels heard, valued, and safe to express their opinions.

### Conclusion: Raise Your Glass (and Your Voices)

In the end, why serve your friends with ordinary glassware when you could be enraging them into lively discussions about the world around them? Transform your gatherings into stimulating arenas where ideas flourish alongside the cocktails. By embracing this daring approach to serving drinks, you not only elevate the drinking experience but also cultivate a culture where political discourse is celebrated rather than shunned. 

As you plan your next soirée, consider this mantra: great conversations can lead to great change—one sip at a time.

U.S. Coronavirus Cases Are Down but Eclipse Spring and Summer Peaks
ByLazaro GamioFeb. 5, 2021
U.S. cases
Down fromall-time peak
But higher than thesummer peak
The worst of the current wave of coronavirus infections seems to be behind us, with the seven-day rolling average of new cases trending down in almost every part of the country. Nationally, that average peaked on Jan. 8 at nearly 260,000 new cases; the figure for Feb. 3, 136,442, amounts to a 47 percent drop from that peak.
Some parts of the country, including the Upper Midwest, are experiencing bigger decreases in new cases than others. Four states in the region — Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa — have seen average daily cases fall by 80 percent or more.
Percent drop in average new cases from winter peak
Based on 7-day rolling average of daily cases.
The places with the steepest decreases tend to be small counties where the overall case count is relatively small, leading to wild swings in the data. Restricting the data to about 600 counties that had at least 100 daily cases at their recent peak shows that cases have fallen 60 percent on average.
Most of the areas on this map showing smaller decreases experienced their winter peaks later, meaning they haven't had as much time to come down. For example, the Midwest peaked in mid-November, while the Eastern Seaboard peaked in mid-January.
The current decline remains most pronounced in the Midwest. In Hennepin County, home to Minneapolis,  daily cases have fallen to roughly 200 from 1,200. Wayne County, home to Detroit, saw a similar drop, to 220 from 1,200.
Even while cases in the United States broadly are trending downward, some parts of the country are still reporting new cases at a rate higher than during the worst peak they experienced last year. This map compares current rates with past peaks, defined here as the highest daily average before Oct. 1. For some states that saw surges early in the pandemic when widespread testing was not yet available, these early peaks may be understated.
Average daily new cases compared with previous peak
Based on 7-day rolling average of daily cases.
Most of the places on the map above experienced a relatively small surge in reported cases during the first wave of the pandemic early last year. While on a downward trajectory now, the current number of new cases is higher than anything they experienced during the first six months of the coronavirus crisis.
Maine, for example, saw relatively low case counts until November, when cases began to rise before peaking in late January at nearly 12 times the level of the state’s peak last year. Even so, the current daily case count in Maine is tame compared with some other parts of the country — such as Texas, whose rate is triple that of Maine when adjusted for population.
In New York State, areas outside of New York City weren’t hit as hard as the city was in the spring last year, but faced a brutal second wave this winter.Hawaiiis the only state in the country where the first wave was more severe than the second wave in terms of reported cases.

It remains to be seen whether thenew variantsof the coronavirus circulating in different parts of the country will trigger another surge in cases. The more contagious variant first identified in the U.K. has now been detected in morethan halfof states. On the other hand, asmore people are vaccinated, transmission rates could fall, preventing a surge.

"**New York Times Report: COVID-19 Cases Experience Significant Decline Amid Ongoing Challenges**

*Published: [Insert Date]*

As we approach the end of winter, the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic is beginning to shift. Current data indicates that new COVID-19 cases have fallen nearly 50 percent since the peak observed on January 8. Despite this encouraging trend, health experts caution that case numbers remain substantially elevated compared to any period before October 1.

**Declining Numbers: A Welcome Shift**

The peak, which saw an alarming surge in infections, prompted renewed public health measures and heightened concerns over healthcare capacity. However, recent reports reveal a significant downturn in cases. By mid-February, new infections have dropped from their January peak of approximately 800,000 to around 400,000, reflecting a notable improvement and illustrating the effectiveness of ongoing vaccination efforts and behavioral changes among the population.

**Long-Term Trends Still Concerning**

While the decline is promising, the current figures still present a stark reality. The recent case counts are substantially higher than those seen before October 1, when the pandemic showed signs of subsiding with fewer than 100,000 daily reported cases. Experts highlight that, despite the recent reduction, the sustained levels of infection contribute to ongoing strain on the healthcare system and prolong the pandemic's impact on everyday life.

**Public Health Response**

In response to the shifting case dynamics, public health officials are strategizing to both capitalize on the decline and address lingering concerns. Encouragement for vaccination and booster shots continues, especially among vulnerable populations, while health officials are closely monitoring any emerging variants that could disrupt progress.

Moreover, maintaining a flexible approach to public health guidelines remains crucial. This includes potential adjustments to mask mandates and social distancing measures, which may be relaxed or intensified depending on evolving case data and hospitalization rates.

**Expert Opinions and Insights**

Health experts emphasize that public complacency must be avoided. Dr. Emily Chen, an infectious disease specialist, warns, ""While it’s certainly encouraging to see a sharp decline in cases, we cannot afford to let our guard down. This reduction is a step in the right direction, but we need to be vigilant and prepared for possible future surges.""

As the nation navigates this transitional phase, the necessity for widespread vaccinations, adherence to safety protocols, and public awareness remains paramount. The history of pandemic response underscores that fluctuations in cases can occur, necessitating sustained vigilance.

**Conclusion**

The significant decline in new COVID-19 cases over the past month brings hope, yet the reality is that challenges remain. The current numbers, still higher than pre-October levels, indicate that ongoing vigilance and proactive public health strategies are essential. As communities navigate these changes, the collective responsibility of individuals, health officials, and policymakers will play a critical role in steering the nation towards a healthier future.

"**Title: Unprecedented Pressure: The President and Georgia’s Election Results**

**By [Your Name]**

**Date: [Insert Date]**

In a stunning revelation that has deepened the national conversation about election integrity, newly released audio recordings reveal that President [Insert President’s Name] pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. This extraordinary interaction, which occurred on January 2, 2021, reflects a broader trend of challenges to electoral legitimacy faced by state officials across the nation.

### The Context

The 2020 presidential election concluded with Joe Biden securing a decisive victory over the incumbent president, [Insert President’s Name]. Georgia, which had not voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992, emerged as a battleground state with close results. Following the election, allegations of widespread voter fraud began to circulate among supporters of the incumbent. Despite numerous audits and recounts, state officials, including Raffensperger, found no evidence of fraud that would alter the election outcome.

### The Call

The release of the audio has underscored the unusual dynamics between federal leadership and state electoral processes. In the recorded conversation, [Insert President's Name] urged Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia. “You’re going to have to say that you recalculated,” the president can be heard saying. This unprecedented move raised concerns among legal experts, political analysts, and voters alike, prompting questions about the implications of such a call on the sanctity of electoral processes.

### Implications for Democracy

Critics argue that this pressure from the president not only undermines the autonomy of state officials but also sets a dangerous precedent for future elections. It challenges the foundational principle of U.S. democracy that electoral outcomes should be determined by the votes of the people rather than political manipulations from higher offices. Legal scholars have pointed out the potential violation of laws prohibiting election interference, suggesting that this episode could prompt further investigations into the conduct of the president and his allies.

### Public Reaction

Public reaction to the news has been extremely polarized. Supporters of [Insert President’s Name] assert that the concerns raised are part of a larger narrative used by Democrats to delegitimize the president and his administration. Meanwhile, a majority of Americans, including many Republican voters, express alarm over the ethical ramifications of the president’s actions. A recent poll indicates that a significant portion of the electorate believes that attempts to overturn the election undermine democracy.

### The Aftermath

As the nation moves further away from the 2020 election, the ramifications of this episode continue to resonate in both political and legal arenas. Various state and federal officials have called for accountability and transparency, advocating for reforms that ensure the protection of electoral integrity. Additionally, lawmakers are considering legislation designed to fortify voting rights and safeguard elections from any undue political influence.

### Conclusion

The recorded pressure exerted by the president on Georgia's secretary of state is not just an isolated incident; it is emblematic of larger challenges facing American democracy today. The commitment to fair and free elections is central to the nation’s identity, and safeguarding that principle remains crucial as the U.S. approaches future electoral contests. As investigations continue and conversations progress, the implications of this unprecedented demand are likely to be felt for years to come.

Where to Eat: New York City
It’s Sandwich Week!
Here’s how our grand survey of sandwiches in all five boroughs came to be, plus some staff favorites.
ByNikita Richardson
Last week, Becky Hughes took over the newsletter because I was up to my eyeballs in spreadsheets filled with sandwiches. This week, all that beautiful organization came together in the form of our list of “57 Sandwiches That Define New York City,” a grand survey of all five boroughs through the lens of its most inspired dishes between two slices of bread.
How the sandwich gets made
When the sandwich project was born, I knew the selections had to reflect a few key factors: the city’s history of immigration and globalism, its most iconic institutions (Jewish and Italian delis, neighborhood mainstays), its ingenious chefs and, most important, all five boroughs.
I came up with a list of about 50 leads, then asked our Food staff to share their adds and to highlight any blind spots. We compiled a list of over 100 sandwiches, and after three weeks of scouting, narrowed the selection to 57 worthy choices. From there, our tireless photo editor Gabriel H. Sanchez commissioned three photographers to photograph every one of them.
Because I have a car, I took on the Bronx and Staten Island. (Shout out to Pamela Silvestri, the food editor at the Staten Island Advance, for taking me out to try sandwiches on a rainy Friday afternoon.) But my favorite sandwich was a little closer to home: I haven’t stopped thinking about the vegan lobster roll at Aunts et Uncles in Brooklyn. It proves that necessity truly is the mother of invention, because I need that “lobster” roll made with hearts of palm in my life.
I thought I’d ask my fellow sandwich hunters about which sandwiches stood out to them the most during our delicious journey across the city.",human,It’s Sandwich Week!
"**Title: It's Sandwich Week! Celebrating the Versatility of the Beloved Staple**

**Subtitle: From Classic Combinations to Innovative Creations, Here’s Your Guide to Sandwich Week**

**By [Your Name]**

**Date: [Current Date]**

---

As the calendar turns, food enthusiasts around the world eagerly anticipate Sandwich Week—a time dedicated to celebrating one of the most beloved culinary staples. From the classic peanut butter and jelly to gourmet creations that push the boundaries of flavor and texture, sandwiches have become a canvas for creativity and comfort. Here’s a deep dive into this year’s Sandwich Week, showcasing its history, popular variations, and exciting ways to partake in the festivities.

### A Brief History of Sandwiches

The origins of the sandwich can be traced back to the 18th century, credited to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich. Legend has it that he requested his meat be served between slices of bread to avoid interrupting his gambling game. This convenient meal quickly gained popularity and has since evolved into countless variations enjoyed across the globe.

### The Anatomy of a Great Sandwich

At its core, a sandwich is made up of three essential components: the bread, the filling, and the condiments. Each element plays a crucial role in the overall experience:

1. **Bread**: The foundation of any sandwich. From crispy baguettes and soft brioche to hearty whole grain and gluten-free options, the type of bread can drastically alter the taste and texture.

2. **Fillings**: Meat, cheese, vegetables, and spreads come together to create vibrant flavor combinations. Whether you're a fan of roast beef, fresh mozzarella, or grilled veggies, the fillings are where personal preference shines.

3. **Condiments**: The finishing touch. Mustard, mayo, aioli, and hot sauce not only add moisture but enhance the overall flavor profile and elevate the experience.

### Signature Sandwiches to Try

Each region boasts its own iconic sandwich worthy of exploration:

- **The Reuben**: A classic deli favorite, this New York staple features corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing on rye bread.

- **Banh Mi**: A Vietnamese fusion sandwich that combines a crispy baguette with savory meats, pickled vegetables, and fresh herbs, delivering a delightful crunch and a burst of flavors.

- **Cubano**: Originating from Cuba, this pressed sandwich melds succulent pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard, creating an irresistible combination distinct to Cuban cuisines.

- **Veggie Delight**: For those seeking plant-based options, a sandwich packed with fresh vegetables, hummus, and avocado can be equally satisfying and flavorful.

### Innovative Sandwich Trends

This Sandwich Week, chefs and home cooks are experimenting with innovative uses of ingredients that challenge traditional notions of sandwiches. Here are some standout trends:

- **Charcoal Bread**: Dark, strikingly colored bread made with activated charcoal is gaining traction, offering a visually stunning base for sandwiches.

- **Plant-Based Meats**: The rise of vegan and vegetarian diets has led to a surge in delicious plant-based alternatives that replicate the textures and flavors of traditional meats.

- **Global Influences**: More than ever, sandwiches are embracing international flavors, incorporating spices and ingredients from diverse cuisines.

### How to Celebrate Sandwich Week

1. **Visit a Local Deli or Café**: Support local businesses by trying their specialty sandwiches. Many eateries offer limited-time selections just for Sandwich Week.

2. **Host a Sandwich-Making Party**: Gather friends and family for a fun-filled sandwich-making event. Provide a variety of breads, fillings, and condiments for personalized creations.

3. **Creative Social Media Share**: Showcase your favorite sandwich creation on social media with the hashtag #SandwichWeek and join the conversation with food lovers everywhere.

4. **Experiment at Home**: Try your hand at making your own signature sandwich. Push the boundaries with unexpected ingredients and share your recipe online.

### Conclusion

Sandwich Week is more than just a celebration of food; it's a tribute to creativity and community. Whether you prefer classic combinations or novel innovations, there’s a sandwich for everyone to enjoy. So, grab a loaf of bread, your favorite fillings, and join the festivities—because there’s no better time to pay homage to this magnificent meal.

"**Title: Officer Gerry Realin: A First Responder's Harrowing Hours Inside the Pulse Nightclub**

**By [Your Name]**

**Date: [current date]**

**Location: Orlando, Florida**

On June 12, 2016, the city of Orlando was shaken by one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, which took place at the Pulse nightclub. In the aftermath of this tragedy, Officer Gerry Realin of the Orlando Police Department's hazardous materials team emerged as a pivotal figure in the response effort. His experience serving in the heart of crisis sheds light on the emotional and professional toll that such horrific events place on first responders.

### The Call to Action

When the shooting began just after 2 a.m., chaos erupted inside Pulse, a popular venue frequented by the LGBTQ+ community. By the time the ordeal ended, 49 lives had been lost and dozens more injured. The immediate response involved local law enforcement, emergency medical personnel, and various specialized teams. Officer Realin and his hazardous materials unit received the call to assist, tasked not only with ensuring the safety of the area but also with handling the potentially hazardous conditions left in the wake of the shooter.

### Entering the Scene

As Officer Realin approached Pulse, he was acutely aware of the gravity of the situation. ""It was like stepping into a different world,"" he recalled. ""The noise, the chaos, and the palpable sense of fear were overwhelming."" Dressed in protective gear, Realin and his team prepared to enter the nightclub, fully aware of the emotional weight of what lay ahead.

Once inside, the scene was devastating. Blood-soaked floors, abandoned personal belongings, and the echoes of gunfire still ringing in their ears painted a harrowing picture. Realin and his team worked tirelessly to sift through the aftermath, offering support to fellow officers and trying to comprehend the magnitude of the horror they were witnessing.

### Emotional Toll

The hours spent inside the nightclub were physically strenuous and emotionally taxing. Officer Realin described a profound sense of responsibility to honor the victims and assist families. ""Every moment felt like time stood still, and the weight of what we were seeing was almost too much to bear,"" he said. The team’s role was critical not just for securing the site and collecting evidence but also for ensuring that the area was safe for other first responders and loved ones yearning for information about those still unaccounted for.

### The Role of Support

In the wake of the massacre, Officer Realin and many of his colleagues sought mental health support to process the traumatic experiences they faced that night. The police department implemented counseling services for first responders, recognizing that the psychological toll of such events can linger long after physical work is done. ""It's okay to not be okay,"" Realin emphasized. ""Seeking help is a sign of strength.""

### Legacy and Reflection

Years after the targeted attack at Pulse, Officer Gerry Realin remains an advocate for both the LGBTQ+ community and the mental health of first responders.

"**Title: Trump's Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci Removed After Just 10 Days at Request of New Chief of Staff John Kelly**

**By [Your Name]**

**Date: [Insert Date]**

In a swift and unexpected turn of events, President Donald Trump has removed Anthony Scaramucci from his position as White House communications director, just ten days after his appointment. This decision comes at the recommendation of John Kelly, who recently assumed the role of White House chief of staff, signaling a possible shift in the administration’s approach to managing its public messaging.

Scaramucci's tenure at the helm of the communications team has been tumultuous from the outset. Appointed on July 21, 2017, he entered a chaotic environment following the resignation of Sean Spicer, the previous communications director. Known for his brash style and propensity for media engagements, Scaramucci was seen by some as a controversial but bold choice, one who might shake up the often-stagnant communications operation.

However, the 53-year-old former hedge fund manager's time in the role quickly turned contentious. His candid remarks and unfiltered commentary drew immediate scrutiny, culminating in a controversial interview with The New Yorker where Scaramucci disparaged several senior White House officials, including then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. This interview sparked backlash within the administration, contributing to a perception that Scaramucci's approach was misaligned with the more traditional and disciplined style that Kelly aims to impose.

John Kelly, a retired four-star general, has made headlines recently for his commitment to restoring order and structure within the West Wing. His reputation for discipline and decorum contrasts sharply with Scaramucci's freewheeling style. According to sources within the White House, Kelly believed that Scaramucci's continued presence would jeopardize the stability and professionalism he is determined to establish.

Despite his short-lived role, Scaramucci’s impact was immediately felt in the press. His fiery personality and penchant for dramatic statements injected a new energy into the communications team, but also highlighted the uncertainties within a White House grappling with significant personnel challenges. Observers noted that Scaramucci's removal could pave the way for a more cohesive communications strategy, one that aligns more closely with the new chief of staff’s vision for the administration.

Reactions to Scaramucci’s dismissal have been mixed, reflecting the divisive nature of his brief tenure. Supporters argue that he brought a refreshing candor to a West Wing often shrouded in secrecy, while critics contend that his lack of experience in government communications ultimately proved detrimental.

As President Trump navigates these staff changes, the implications for his administration's messaging strategy remain to be seen. With the midterm elections approaching and significant issues looming on the horizon—from healthcare reform to immigration policy—how the White House communicates with the public and the media will be crucial in shaping public perception and political outcomes.

In conclusion, Anthony Scaramucci's abrupt removal after just ten days serves as a potent reminder of the volatility that has characterized the Trump administration. With John Kelly at the helm, the West Wing may be heading for a more structured and predictable approach, as the new chief of staff seeks to stabilize an often tumultuous communications landscape.

Highlights From Trump’s Impeachment Defense
Lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump delivered a short defense on Friday, arguing that his conviction would threaten free speech and falsely equating his conduct with Democrats’ use of the word “fight.”
“Like every other politically motivated witch hunt the left has engaged in over the past four years, this impeachment is completely divorced from the facts, the evidence and the interests of the American people.” “To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behavior is a preposterous and monstrous lie.” “A small group who came to engage in violent and menacing behavior hijacked the event for their own purposes.” “This sham impeachment also poses a serious threat to freedom of speech for political leaders of both parties at every level of government. The Senate should be extremely careful about the president, the precedent, this case will set.” “We heard a lot this week about ‘fight like hell,’ but they cut off the video before they showed you the president’s optimistic, patriotic words that followed immediately after.” “Fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children and for our beloved country, and I say this despite all that’s happened, the best is yet to come.” “This case, unfortunately, is about political hatred. It has become very clear that the House Democrats hate Donald Trump. This type of political hatred has no place in our political institutions, and certainly no place in the law. This hatred has led the House managers to manipulate and selectively edit Mr. Trump’s speech to make it falsely appear that he sought to incite the crowd to violently attack the Capitol.” “Suddenly, the word ‘fight’ is off limits? Spare us the hypocrisy and false indignation. It’s a term used over and over and over again by politicians on both sides of the aisle. And of course, the Democrat House managers know that the word ‘fight’ has been used figuratively in political speech forever. But don’t take it from me. It’s best to listen to them.” “We are in a fight.” “We are in a fight.” “Democrats are fighting as hard as we can.” “Democrats are standing up to fight.” “We know how to fight. We like a good fight.” “Democrats are going to fight like hell.” “We fight like hell.” “So why are we here? Politics. Their goal is to eliminate a political opponent. To substitute their judgment for the will of the voters.” “We will not take most of our time today, us of the defense, in the hopes that you will take back these hours and use them to get delivery of Covid relief to the American people.”

"**Title:** Trump's Legal Defense Argues Conviction Threatens Free Speech

**By**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Insert Date]  
**Location:** New York, NY

In a high-stakes legal battle that has captivated the nation, lawyers representing former President Donald J. Trump presented a succinct defense on Friday, contending that a conviction against their client could set a troubling precedent for free speech in America. The defense highlighted the former president’s public statements, framing them within the broader context of political discourse and numerous instances of similar rhetoric used by Democrats.

### Context of the Case

This legal proceeding forms part of a series of ongoing challenges Trump faces as he navigates various allegations and charges stemming from his tenure as president and his actions following the 2020 election. Central to the defense’s argument was the assertion that Trump’s remarks, often characterized as incendiary or controversial, should be understood as part of the robust tapestry of American political speech rather than as criminal conduct.

### Defense Strategy

Trump’s attorneys made their case on the basis that equating the former president’s use of the term “fight” with that of several Democratic leaders dilutes the gravity of the accusations against him. They highlighted past instances where prominent Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, have similarly invoked the idea of 'fighting' on various issues ranging from social justice to healthcare. 

**“When some politicians talk about 'fighting for' their causes, it is not met with the same scrutiny and demands for consequences as it is when President Trump uses the word,”** one of Trump’s lawyers stated during the proceedings. This argument aimed to illustrate what they termed a double standard in political rhetoric and its judicial implications.

### The Free Speech Argument

The defense’s pivot to free speech as a cornerstone of their argument underscores a significant legal and constitutional principle. They emphasized that the First Amendment protects the right to free expression, even when that expression includes charged or provocative language. The defense maintained that convicting Trump would not only undermine his rights but could also set a worrying precedent impacting political figures across the spectrum.

Lawyers reiterated that restricting political speech based on perceived incitement could lead to a chilling effect, stifling not just Trump but a wide array of voices within the political arena. This argument resonates with many who emphasize the importance of preserving robust and sometimes contentious discourse within a democracy.

### Counterarguments and Public Reaction

While Trump’s lawyers rallied around the notion of free speech, critics have pointed out the responsibility that comes with the exercise of such freedoms. Opponents argue that rhetoric used by leaders carries significant weight and can lead to real-world consequences, particularly in the highly charged atmosphere surrounding the January 6 Capitol riots.

Public response remains deeply polarized, with proponents of Trump's narrative rallying around the free speech argument, while detractors express growing concern over what they see as an attempt to normalize violent and incendiary rhetoric within the political landscape.

### Conclusion

As Trump’s legal saga unfolds, the implications of this case extend far beyond the former president. The arguments presented by his defense team reflect deeper questions about the boundaries of free speech, the standards applied to political rhetoric, and the potential consequences of blurring those lines. As the trial progresses, the legal community and the public alike will be watching closely to see how these arguments are received and the potential influence they may have on future political discourse in America.",ai,"Lawyers for former President Donald J.

"**Title: President Obama’s Physical Examination Results Released by White House**

**Date: October 3, 2023**

**By: Staff Writer**

*Washington, D.C.* — In a disclosure that has reignited discussions about health and transparency in leadership, the White House has released the results of President Barack Obama’s recent physical examination, conducted by Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, who served as the White House physician under both President Obama and President Trump.

The examination took place on September 30, 2023, during which Dr. Jackson conducted a thorough evaluation of the 62-year-old former president, who served two terms from 2009 to 2017. The results were shared with the public in a briefing held by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. 

### Key Findings of the Examination

1. **General Health Status**  
   Dr. Jackson reported that President Obama is in “excellent health” overall, maintaining a fitness level that is commendable for his age. ""He is active and exercises regularly,"" Jackson stated, emphasizing that the president's commitment to a healthy lifestyle continues to serve him well.

2. **Cardiovascular Health**  
   The report highlighted that President Obama’s cardiovascular systems are functioning properly, with an optimal blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. Cholesterol levels were noted to be within healthy limits, with a total cholesterol count below 200 mg/dL.

3. **Mental Acuity**  
   Dr. Jackson also assessed the cognitive functions of the former president, noting sharp reasoning and clear communication skills. ""His mental acuity is excellent, and he shows no signs of cognitive decline,"" said Jackson, a reassuring note for the public and policy-makers alike.

4. **Physical Activity Level**  
   The examination report outlined Obama’s active lifestyle, which includes regular workouts involving cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility training. Jackson mentioned that Obama enjoys running, basketball, and yoga, which contribute to both his physical and mental well-being.

5. **Dietary Considerations**  
   Obama’s balanced dietary habits were also outlined, with a focus on plant-based foods, lean proteins, and a reduced intake of processed sugars and fats. Jackson remarked on the benefits of these choices, stating that the former president’s diet plays a critical role in maintaining his overall health.

### Public Reactions

The release of Obama’s physical examination results has sparked discussions across social media platforms and news outlets regarding the importance of health transparency for public figures. Many supporters have expressed their relief and satisfaction with the findings, reiterating their trust in Obama’s leadership capabilities.

Conversely, some critics have emphasized the need for comprehensive medical transparency from all leaders, suggesting that future examinations should cover a broader range of health metrics to fully inform the public.

### Conclusion

As discussions surrounding health and leadership continue, the White House's publication of President Obama’s physical examination results serves as a reminder of the significant role health plays in governance. While Obama's current standing as a former president means he is no longer in the limelight as a candidate, keeping the public informed about the health of former leaders fosters a culture of accountability and trust in political institutions.

**Subtitle: A Journey Through Parisian Charm and Modernity**

**By [Your Name] | Date: October 28, 2023**

Paris, known as ""La Ville Lumière,"" is more than just a geographic location; it represents a cultural epicenter that has shaped the world through its art, fashion, cuisine, and history. Nestled along the Seine River, the aura of Paris captivates millions of visitors each year, drawing them into its rich tapestry of tradition and innovation.

**The Allure of Parisian Landmarks**

At the heart of Paris lies its iconic landmarks, each telling a story of its own. The Eiffel Tower, a symbol of romance and architectural genius, draws millions with its stunning views and intricate iron lattice design. Constructed for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, this landmark has become synonymous with the city itself.

The Louvre, another jewel in the crown of Paris, houses one of the world's most extensive art collections, including the enigmatic Mona Lisa and the majestic Winged Victory of Samothrace. This former royal palace represents not just artistic mastery, but an evolution of cultural expression over centuries.

**Culinary Delights: A Taste of Paris**

Paris is also a gastronomic paradise, offering a range of culinary experiences from classic bistros to Michelin-starred restaurants. The aroma of freshly baked croissants wafts through the streets, inviting passersby to indulge in breakfast at a local café. Must-try dishes include Coq au Vin, Ratatouille, and the world-famous Crêpe Suzette, each reflecting the intricate fusion of flavors that define French cuisine.

One cannot overlook the coffee culture that permeates the city—a leisurely cup of espresso at a sidewalk café is as much about the beverage as it is about the experience of people-watching in this vibrant metropolitan hub.

**Fashion and Artistry: The Chic Side of Paris**

Paris is often regarded as the capital of fashion, hosting prestigious events like Paris Fashion Week, where designers unveil their latest creations to an eager global audience. The streets themselves serve as a runway, showcasing the latest trends and styles, from couture to street fashion.

In addition to fashion, Paris is a cradle of artistic innovation, home to world-renowned artists such as Picasso, Monet, and Van Gogh. The Montmartre district, once a haven for bohemians, retains its artistic spirit, with street artists continuing to capture the essence of the city on canvas.

**Historical Echoes: París Through the Ages**

The city boasts a profound historical lineage. The Cathedral of Notre-Dame, with its gothic architecture, has witnessed the passage of time, from its construction in the 12th century to its restoration after the tragic 2019 fire. This historical resilience reflects the spirit of Paris itself, enduring and adapting through trials.

In the heart of the Marais district, visitors can explore the remnants of the French Revolution and its significant impact on contemporary society. Museums and memorials serve as reminders of a tumultuous past that has shaped the modern French identity.

**The Green Soul of Paris**

Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on sustainability within the city. Parks such as the Luxembourg Gardens and the Jardin des Tuileries offer serene escapes from the urban hustle, while initiatives to enhance green spaces, like the ""15-minute city"" concept, aim to make Paris more livable and environmentally friendly.

The promotion of cycling and pedestrian-friendly streets reflects a commitment to not only decrease carbon footprints but also improve the overall quality of life for Parisians and visitors alike.

**Conclusion: Paris, An Ever-Evolving Tapestry**

Paris is not merely a destination; it is an experience woven with the threads of history, creativity, and daily life. The city's ability to embrace change while honoring its past is what continues to enchant those who visit. As we navigate this cultural landscape, Paris remains, to quote Victor Hugo, ""a book of pride,"" waiting to be written and discovered anew.

"# Premier League Survival Battles Heat Up as the XFL Prepares for Championship Showdown

**By [Your Name]**  
*October 30, 2023*

As the calendar turns to November, two of the most exciting narratives in sports are unfolding on opposite sides of the Atlantic. The English Premier League (EPL) is witnessing a fierce scramble as clubs fight to avoid the dreaded relegation zone, while in the United States, the XFL gears up for its championship game, promising a showdown that will crown its inaugural titleholder. This dichotomy not only encapsulates the essence of competitive sports but also highlights the unique structures and stakes present in each league.

## Premier League: The Fight for Survival

Entering the final months of the EPL season, the pressure mounts for teams at the lower end of the standings. With only a few points separating several clubs, every match will be critical. The bottom three teams will face relegation to the English Football League Championship, significantly impacting finances, player contracts, and the future of the clubs.

### Key Players and Clubs at Risk

1. **Norwich City**: Currently sitting at the bottom of the table, Norwich has struggled to find form. Despite a promising start to the season, injuries to key players have hampered their ability to compete effectively.

2. **Burnley**: Known for their gritty style, Burnley finds themselves in a precarious situation. The club’s management is under pressure to galvanize the squad to secure vital points in the coming fixtures.

3. **Fulham**: Once a yo-yo club in the EPL, Fulham looks to stabilize their place in the top flight. Recent performances have shown promise, but consistency remains a concern.

### Upcoming Fixtures

As the league enters a crucial phase, several matches will be pivotal for clubs fighting relegation. Notably, matches between direct rivals can prove decisive, with teams needing to maximize their points haul against each other. Fans and analysts will closely watch these encounters, which carry the weight of survival implications.

## XFL: Championship City Awaits

While the EPL grapples with the threat of relegation, the XFL is on the threshold of crowning its champion. The league, which has gained traction since its revival, has seen teams develop formidable rosters and passionate fan bases.

### Path to the Championship

1. **Team Performance**: Individual teams have showcased remarkable resilience and creativity throughout the season. The playoff structure has provided unexpected drama, as underdog teams have outperformed expectations, challenging the touts.

2. **Star Players**: The XFL has drawn attention not just for its competitive matches but for its players. Stars have emerged, capturing the imaginations of fans and offering glimpses of what might be the future of professional football.

### Championship Preview

The championship game promises to be a thrilling encounter with both fanfare and competitive spirit. With stakes at an all-time high, the winner not only will take home the coveted trophy but also earn a place in the hearts of fans—potentially setting the foundation for a legacy in the evolving landscape of American football.

## Conclusion: Contrasting Pathways in Sports

About the data
In data for Nebraska, The Times primarily relies on reports from the state, as well as health districts or county governments that often report ahead of the state. Nebraska typically has data updates several times a week. Prior to May 15, 2021, it released new data daily. The state reports cases and deaths based on a person’s permanent or usual residence.
The Times has identified reporting anomalies or methodology changes in the data.
The tallies on this page include cases and deaths that have been identified by public health officials as probable coronavirus patients through antigen testing.
Confirmed cases and deaths, which are widely considered to be an undercount of the true toll, are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a molecular laboratory test.Probable cases and deathscount individuals who meet criteria for other types of testing, symptoms and exposure, as developed by national and local governments.
Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when possible. For agencies that do not report data every day, variation in the schedule on which cases or deaths are reported, such as around holidays, can also cause an irregular pattern in averages.

**By [Your Name]**  
**Date: [Insert Date]**  
**Location: New York, NY**

---

The day following a devastating mass shooting in Oregon, the United Nations voiced urgent concern over gun violence in the United States. In a statement relayed by UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon emphasized the need for common sense regulations aimed at reducing firearms-related incidents.

### A Tragic Event

On [insert date of shooting], a mass shooting unfolded at [insert specific location in Oregon], resulting in multiple casualties and injuries, leaving the community and the nation in mourning. This tragedy comes during a troubling trend of rising gun violence in the U.S., prompting calls for increased scrutiny on gun laws.

### UN's Call for Action

In his remarks, Dujarric conveyed Ban Ki-moon's sentiments, highlighting the UN's longstanding position on the importance of international norms around gun control. “The Secretary-General reiterates that every country must take steps to protect its citizens from gun violence, which is a global concern,” Dujarric stated. 

Ban Ki-moon urged the U.S. government to consider legislative measures that would address the root causes of gun violence. He pointed out that many countries have successfully implemented policies to reduce gun-related deaths, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach that respects rights while protecting lives.

### The Context of Gun Violence in America

The United States has experienced an alarming increase in mass shootings, with many attributing this rise to a combination of factors, including easy access to firearms and systemic issues such as mental health and domestic violence. Analysts report that, since the beginning of the year, the country has seen more than [insert number] mass shootings, a statistic that has sparked debate among lawmakers and community leaders.

#### Community Response

In the wake of the Oregon shooting, community members have come together for vigils and speeches advocating for more stringent gun control measures. Activist groups are pushing for a renewed dialogue on the effectiveness of existing laws and the implementation of new strategies to prevent such tragedies in the future.

### Political Implications

The UN's call for action arrives amid a polarized political climate in the U.S., where discussions surrounding gun control often devolve into heated disagreements. Following tragedies, there is typically a moment of reflection and calls for reform; however, substantial legislative changes remain elusive.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now faced with the challenge of addressing the concerns raised by the UN while balancing the Second Amendment rights of citizens. The recent statement from Ban Ki-moon is likely to reignite debate among politicians and may impact future elections as constituents demand action.

### Conclusion

As the United States grapples with the aftermath of the Oregon mass shooting, the international community watches closely, reminding the nation of its obligations to safeguard the lives of its citizens against the pervasive threat of gun violence. The UN Secretary-General’s call for action is a poignant reminder of the global implications of domestic policies and the collective responsibility to protect human life across borders. 

As advocates push for change, the hope remains that meaningful dialogue will lead to reforms that prioritize safety without compromising constitutional rights.

"### Unlocking Calm: The Benefits of Controlled Breathing

**By [Your Name]**

*Date: October 8, 2023*

In today’s fast-paced world, many of us often find ourselves feeling on edge—whether it's due to work demands, personal pressures, or global uncertainties. However, a simple yet effective remedy lies in the practice of controlled breathing. Recent studies highlight how this age-old technique can significantly reduce stress, enhance alertness, and even boost the immune system.

#### The Science Behind Controlled Breathing

Controlled breathing, often referred to as ""deep breathing"" or ""diaphragmatic breathing,"" involves deliberate, conscious manipulation of one’s breath. This practice is rooted in various traditions, from yoga to mindfulness meditation, and it is gaining traction in modern psychological and physiological studies.

Researchers have discovered that controlled breathing prompts the body to enter a state of relaxation, counteracting the stress-induced ""fight or flight"" response. When we focus on our breath, we engage the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms the heart rate and lowers blood pressure—key elements in reducing overall stress.

#### Reducing Stress: A Breath of Fresh Air

Numerous studies support the claim that controlled breathing can diminish feelings of stress and anxiety. A study published in the journal *Frontiers in Psychology* found that participants who engaged in regular deep breathing exercises reported lower levels of anxiety and improved mood. The act of focusing on one’s breath can serve as a form of mindfulness, distracting the mind from stressors and fostering a sense of inner peace.

#### Enhancing Alertness

Interestingly, controlled breathing doesn’t merely promote relaxation; it can also bolster alertness. According to a study in the *Journal of Cognitive Enhancement*, participants who practiced short bursts of controlled breathing reported increased focus and mental clarity. This is largely because proper oxygen intake aids cerebral function, improving attention and decision-making capabilities.

#### Boosting the Immune System

In the context of public health, the immune-enhancing effects of controlled breathing can’t be overlooked. Research indicates that deep breathing exercises can influence the immune response by reducing inflammation and modulating stress hormones. A study in *Psychosomatic Medicine* revealed that individuals practicing controlled breathing techniques exhibited a more robust immune response during periods of stress compared to those who did not.

#### Practical Techniques for Everyone

Incorporating controlled breathing into your daily routine doesn’t require significant time or resources. Here are a few techniques you can try:

1. **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Sit or lie down comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your diaphragm (not your chest) to expand. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Aim for a ratio of 4 counts in, 4 counts hold, and 6 counts out.

2. **Box Breathing**: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, and hold again for 4 counts. Repeat this cycle several times to regain focus and calm.

3. **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 7 counts, and exhale through your mouth for 8 counts. This technique is especially beneficial before sleep.

#### Conclusion

As feelings of anxiety and stress become ubiquitous in our daily lives, controlled breathing emerges as a potent and accessible tool for mental and physical well-being. By taking just a few moments each day to focus on our breath, we can cultivate a sense of calm, enhance our alertness, and support our immune systems against the stresses of modern life. So, the next time you feel on edge, remember—just breathe.

"### How Different Groups Voted: A Comprehensive Analysis of Voter Demographics

**By [Your Name]**  
*Published on [Date]*

As the dust settles from the recent elections, a closer look at the voting patterns reveals significant insights into how various demographic groups cast their ballots. Understanding these patterns not only illuminates the electoral landscape but also provides a roadmap for future political strategies. This article explores the voting behavior of distinct groups, including age, race, education, and geographical location.

#### 1. **Age Groups**

**Younger Voters (18-29 years)**  
In 2023, younger voters continued to demonstrate a trend of progressive choices, with approximately 55% supporting Democratic candidates. This trend reflects a growing concern for issues such as climate change, student debt, and social justice that resonate with this demographic. Engaging platforms like TikTok and Instagram were crucial in mobilizing this age group.

**Middle-Aged Voters (30-44 years)**  
Voters in this category showed a split, with around 48% backing Republican candidates. Economic issues, particularly inflation and job security, weighed heavily on the minds of middle-aged voters. Many expressed a desire for pragmatic solutions rather than partisan rhetoric.

**Older Voters (45 years and above)**  
Older voters largely favored Republican candidates, with 57% casting their votes for the GOP. Safety, healthcare, and social security were pivotal issues for this demographic. The appeal of traditional values and concerns over changing social norms also factored into their electoral choices.

#### 2. **Racial and Ethnic Groups**

**White Voters**  
White voters comprised a substantial portion of the electorate, with about 72% voting for Republican candidates. Economic stability and immigration policies were dominant issues within this group. However, there was a notable increase in support for Democratic candidates among younger white voters, indicating a potential shift in future elections.

**Black Voters**  
Black voters overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates, with an estimated 85% choosing the party. Issues such as police reform, racial equality, and economic disparities remained critical motivators for this demographic, emphasizing the importance of targeted outreach by the Democratic Party.

**Latino Voters**  
The Latino vote showed signs of diversification, with 60% supporting Democrats, particularly in urban areas. However, in certain states, such as Texas and Florida, there was a significant portion—around 40%—that leaned Republican. Key issues included immigration policies, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

**Asian American Voters**  
Asian American voters demonstrated a strong preference for Democratic candidates, with around 70% backing the party. This group is increasingly motivated by issues such as immigration reform, educational access, and representation.

#### 3. **Educational Attainment**

**College Graduates**  
Voters with a college degree leaned heavily towards Democrats, with more than 60% supporting Democratic candidates. Education-related issues, including student debt relief and access to quality education, were top priorities for this group.

**Non-College Graduates**  
Among non-college graduates, voting patterns were more fragmented. While a slight majority favored Republicans (about 52%), there was noticeable support for Democratic candidates among those concerned about healthcare and minimum wage increases.

#### 4. **Geographical Trends**

**Urban vs. Rural Voting**  
Urban areas overwhelmingly favored Democratic candidates, with around 70% of city-dwellers voting blue. Issues such as public transportation, affordable housing, and environmental concerns resonated strongly in these regions. In contrast, rural voters leaned Republican, with around 65% supporting GOP candidates, prioritizing agricultural policies and traditional values.

**Suburban Areas**  
Suburban voters exhibited a more balanced divide, with approximately 50% voting for Democrats and 48% for Republicans. The suburban vote has become a battleground, influenced by issues such as school policies, community safety, and healthcare access.

### Conclusion

The 2023 elections highlighted the complexities of voter sentiment across various demographics. By understanding the motivations and issues that matter to different groups, political parties can better tailor their messages and policies to resonate with a diverse electorate. As we move closer to future elections, the continued analysis of these voting patterns will be crucial for both parties in strategizing their outreach and engagement efforts.

Mavis Staples Is an American Institution. She’s Not Done Singing Yet.
After more than seven decades onstage, the gospel and soul great decided last year that it was time to retire. Then she realized she still had work to do.
ByGrayson Haver Currin
Reporting from Chicago and Los Angeles
On a rainy April day in Chicago, Mavis Staples sat in the restaurant of the towering downtown Chicago building where she’s lived for the past four years. For two hours, she talked about the Civil Rights movement and faith. And finally, she mentioned her old flame Bob Dylan.
The singer-songwriter first proposed to Staples after a kiss at the 1963 Newport Folk Festival; she hid from him during a show at the Apollo decades later, fearing he’d ask again. They’ve remained friends, even taking daily strolls during a 2016 tour together. She’d heard rumors he would soon retire, finally wrapping his fabled Never Ending Tour. Staples knew he would hate it.
“Oh,Bobby: He gotta keep on singing,” Staples said. “I could handle it more than him. I will call him and say, ‘Don’t retire, Bobby. You don’t know what you’re doing.’”
Staples speaks from experience: Late in the summer of 2023, soon after turning 84, she told her manager she was done. She’d been on the road for 76 years, ever since her father, Roebuck Staples, known as Pops, assembled a family band when she was 8. The Staple Singers became a gospel fulcrum of the Civil Rights movement and, later, a force for bending genres — mixing funk, rock and soul inside their spiritual mission, an all-American alchemy. The band’s mightiest singer and sole survivor since the death of her sisterYvonnein 2018 and brother,Pervis, in 2021, Mavis remained in high demand, a historical treasure commanding a thunderous contralto.
“Being an American and not believing in royalty, meeting her was the closest I’d ever felt,” said Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, who marveled at her while watching “The Last Waltz” decades before he produced a string of her poignant albums. “I felt the same way when I met Johnny Cash, like meeting a dollar bill or bald eagle.”
A seemingly indomitable extrovert, Staples had deeply resented being homebound during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. So she returned to the road with gusto, playing more than 50 shows last summer. But in July, she missed the end of a moving walkway in Germany and fell on her face. Was this, she wondered, the life she wanted? She’d previously mentioned retirement, but now she insisted.",human,Mavis Staples Is an American Institution. She’s Not Done Singing Yet.

*Date: [Insert Date]*  

In the rich tapestry of American music, few voices resonate with the same power and authenticity as that of Mavis Staples. The Grammy Award-winning singer, civil rights activist, and member of the legendary Staple Singers has been a formidable presence in the music scene for over six decades. Known for her soulful blend of gospel, R&B, and folk, Staples stands not just as a performer but as a vital cultural institution, a living bridge between the struggles of the past and the futures yet to unfold.

### A Legacy of Resilience and Activism

Born on July 10, 1939, in Chicago, Illinois, Mavis Staples was raised in a family steeped in musical tradition. Her father, Roebuck ""Pops"" Staples, founded the Staple Singers, a gospel group that garnered national acclaim for their efforts to bring social justice and healing through music. From the beginning, Mavis was not only a performer; she became an important voice in the civil rights movement, using her platform as a musician to advocate for equality and justice. Her collaboration with icons like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and participation in marches are profound elements of her legacy.

### Evolution of Sound

Mavis Staples’ musical evolution is remarkable. Her early work with the Staple Singers produced unforgettable hits like ""I'll Take You There,"" which became an anthem of hope and resilience during the civil rights era. As genres evolved, so did Staples; she seamlessly transitioned from traditional gospel to incorporate blues, pop, and rock influences, collaborating with artists across various music styles—from Prince to Jeff Tweedy of Wilco.

In recent years, Staples' music has continued to transcend generational divides. Albums like “If All I Was Was Black” (2017) and “One True Vine” (2013) illustrate her ability to weave contemporary narratives with her distinctive sound, tackling complex social issues with grace and urgency. Her lyrics reflect the trials of modern America while echoing the struggles from decades past, reminding us that the fight for justice is far from over.

### A Sign of the Times

Now, at 84, Mavis Staples remains an active force in the music world. Her recent tours and live performances showcase not only her legendary vocal prowess but also her unyielding spirit. As she traverses the country sharing her music, Staples connects with fans of all ages, proving that good music—not unlike the cause of justice—is timeless. 

In interviews, she has expressed a fervent desire to continue using her voice—not merely for entertainment but for empowerment and solidarity. “I want to make people feel good, make them think, and help heal the world one note at a time,” she says. Her latest projects demonstrate this ongoing commitment to music as a tool for change, with fresh collaborations that infuse her sound with new life while honoring her deep-rooted history.

### An Inspiration for Future Generations

Mavis Staples stands as a beacon of inspiration for artists and activists alike. An enduring symbol of resilience, her contributions remind us of the vital role that music plays in social movements. As younger musicians emerge, drawing influence from her pioneering spirit, they find not only inspiration in her sound but also a roadmap for utilizing their art to uplift and engage.

The future is bright for Mavis Staples, with no signs of slowing down. Her recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame serves as a testament to her indomitable spirit and boundless talent. As she prepares for new records and tours, audiences can be assured that her voice, filled with wisdom and hope, will continue to inspire and ignite change for years to come. 

In the realm of American music and soul, Mavis Staples is more than an artist; she is a national treasure. Her journey is far from over, and she has stories yet to tell and melodies yet to sing. In a world that needs both music and advocacy, Staples remains a vital source of joy and truth, proving that age is merely a number when passion and purpose are involved.

Los productos químicos para el cabello podrían afectar la salud de las mujeres
Cada vez hay más evidencias que relacionan los productos para alisar el cabello con una serie de trastornos de salud sobre todo en mujeres negras.

El pelo alisado ha sido durante mucho tiempo el estándar social de belleza dominante para las mujeres negras, desde la clase trabajadora hasta las que trabajan en el gobierno y las empresas estadounidenses, pasando por las celebridades e incluso alguien en la Casa Blanca. Michelle Obama dijo en 2022 que sintió que tenía que alisarse el pelo mientras ejercía de primera dama en lugar de llevar un estilo natural. “No”, dijo. “No están preparados para ello”. El pelo se puede alisar con calor, pero la inmensa mayoría de las mujeres negras —se calcula que un 89 por ciento— han utilizado alisadores químicos, más fáciles y asequibles, en algún momento de su vida, a menudo desde la infancia.
Sin embargo,cada vez hay más evidencias, muchas de las cuales no han llegado al público, que muestran la relación entre estos productos, comercializados directamente para las mujeres y niñas negras, y una serie de trastornos de salud en las mujeres.
Esto es lo que debes saber sobre los relajantes o alisadores de cabello y tu salud.
Cada vez hay más evidencias que relacionan los alisadores químicos con trastornos de salud en las mujeres
Durante décadas, los científicos han tenido dificultades para explicar por qué las niñas negras muestran signos de pubertad precoz —desarrollo de pechos y vello púbico— con más del doble de frecuencia que las niñas blancas y también antes que las niñas de otros grupos étnicos. El inicio precoz de la pubertad y la menstruación se asocia a una cascada de trastornos de la salud reproductiva. Muchos de estos problemas relacionados con la salud hormonal son más frecuentes en las mujeres negras que en otras mujeres, incluida una forma agresiva de cáncer de mama que contribuye a una tasa de mortalidad por esta enfermedad un 28 por ciento superior que la de las mujeres blancas.
Entre los ingredientes de los relajantes químicos hay varios que se sabe que son alteradores del sistema endocrino.

"**Título:** Los Productos Químicos para el Cabello Podrían Afectar la Salud de las Mujeres

**Por:** [Tu Nombre]  
**Fecha:** [Fecha de Publicación]  

**Introducción**  
Recientemente, un creciente cuerpo de investigación ha comenzado a señalar la posible relación entre los productos químicos utilizados en tratamientos capilares y diversos problemas de salud en las mujeres. Desde el uso habitual de alisantes hasta tintes para el cabello, estos productos, que son parte integral de la rutina de belleza de muchas mujeres, podrían estar asociados con riesgos para la salud que merecen atención.

**El Uso Generalizado de Productos Químicos para el Cabello**  
En la actualidad, millones de mujeres en todo el mundo emplean productos químicos para el cabello para modificar su apariencia. Según la Asociación de Industria de Cosméticos y Perfumistas (PCPC), el mercado de tratamientos para el cabello ha crecido exponencialmente, impulsado por tendencias culturales y sociales que priorizan ciertos estándares de belleza. Sin embargo, estos productos suelen contener una variedad de químicos potencialmente peligrosos, incluidos los ftalatos, el formaldehído y otras sustancias que han sido vinculadas con problemas de salud.

**Investigaciones Recientes**  
Varios estudios recientes han mostrado una preocupación creciente. Un estudio publicado en la revista ""Epidemiology"" encontró que las mujeres que utilizan productos permanentes para el cabello y alisadores de cabello contienen una mayor probabilidad de desarrollar cáncer endometrial. Otra investigación de la Universidad de California en San Francisco sugirió que el uso frecuente de tintes para el cabello podría estar relacionado con un mayor riesgo de cáncer de mama.

Además, la investigación también sugiere que estos productos químicos pueden tener efectos sobre la salud reproductiva, como la disminución de la fertilidad. Expertos en salud pública han instado a los consumidores a ser conscientes de los ingredientes en estos productos y considerar alternativas más seguras.

**El Impacto en la Salud de las Mujeres**  
La exposición crónica a ciertos químicos en los productos para el cabello no sólo está relacionada con el cáncer. También se ha observado que algunos de estos componentes pueden alterar el sistema endocrino, lo cual puede tener efectos de largo alcance en la salud hormonal de las mujeres. Esto podría resultar en desbalances hormonales, que a su vez pueden influir en la salud metabólica, la salud reproductiva y el bienestar general.

**Recomendaciones para los Consumidores**  
La creciente preocupación sobre la seguridad de los productos para el cabello ha llevado a muchos a replantear sus opciones. A continuación, algunas recomendaciones:

1. **Leer Etiquetas**: Antes de comprar un producto capilar, es fundamental leer la etiqueta y buscar productos que no contengan sustancias químicas nocivas, como el formaldehído o los parabenos.
   
2. **Investigar Marcas**: Optar por marcas que sean transparentes sobre sus ingredientes y que ofrezcan alternativas más naturales puede ser una buena estrategia.
   
3. **Consultas Médicas**: Si se presentan síntomas inusuales tras el uso de productos para el cabello, es recomendable buscar atención médica.

4. **Apoyar Regulaciones**: Los consumidores pueden ayudar apoyando iniciativas que busquen una regulación más estricta sobre los productos de belleza y su composición química.

**Conclusión**  
Mientras que los productos químicos para el cabello continúan siendo una parte esencial de muchos regímenes de belleza, es vital que las mujeres sean informadas sobre los potenciales riesgos asociados con su uso. La educación y la conciencia son herramientas clave que pueden empoderar a las consumidoras a tomar decisiones más seguras respecto a su salud y bienestar.

1967: Kiesinger Opens Talks on Unity In Paris
PARIS — West Germany’s new chancellor, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, arrives here tomorrow morning for his first summit conference with French President Charles de Gaulle.
The meeting opens what may prove the most significant series of political talks on European unity in four years. The series includes visits to Paris by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Polish Foreign Minister
                                        Adam Rapacki later this month, and could well reach a climax with a summit meeting of the six Common Market nations in Rome at Easter.
Mr. Kiesinger’s two-day visit here includes three private talks with Gen. de Gaulle, and further discussion involving German Foreign Minister Willy Brandt, French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou and French Foreign
                                        Minister Maurice Couve de Murville. Former foreign minister and current defense minister, Gerhard Schroeder, whom Gen. de Gaulle considers the chief saboteur of the 1963 Franco-German friendship treaty, has been
                                        left home in what Bonn freely concedes was a deliberate good will gesture to Paris.
Observers familiar with Gen. de Gaulle’s known taste for historical anniversaries note that the Franco-German talks will conclude — probably with a joint communiqué — on Jan. 14, the fourth
                                        anniversary of the French president’s veto of British entry into the Common Market. —New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Jan. 13, 1967

"## West Germany’s New Chancellor, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Arrives in Paris for First Summit with President Charles de Gaulle

**Paris, France –** In a significant diplomatic event, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, the newly appointed Chancellor of West Germany, arrived in Paris today to engage in his inaugural summit conference with French President Charles de Gaulle. This meeting marks a pivotal moment in Franco-German relations, as both leaders seek to navigate the complexities of post-war Europe.

### A New Era in Leadership

Kiesinger, who took office just weeks prior to this summit, represents a shift in West Germany’s political landscape. As a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he assumes leadership at a time when the nation is grappling with the remnants of World War II and the burgeoning division of Europe during the Cold War. Observers anticipate that Kiesinger will work to strengthen Germany's ties with France, a key player in the European Community.

### Agenda Highlights

The agenda for the summit encompasses several critical issues, including:

- **European Integration:** Both leaders are expected to discuss strategies for enhancing economic cooperation within the European Economic Community (EEC) to ensure stability and growth.
  
- **NATO and Defense Cooperation:** The ongoing tensions with the Soviet Union will likely prompt discussions about military alliances and defense strategies in the context of NATO.
  
- **Reconciliation Efforts:** More than two decades after the end of World War II, Kiesinger and de Gaulle are poised to address the historical grievances that have shaped their nations' relationships. This reconciliation is viewed as essential for fostering a united Europe.

### Implications for Franco-German Relations

This summit is not merely ceremonial; it symbolizes the commitment of both nations to engage in constructive dialogue. Historical ties remain fraught, yet both leaders seem eager to forge a future based on collaboration rather than competition. Analysts suggest that this meeting could lay the groundwork for future bilateral initiatives.

### Reactions

Political analysts in Berlin and Paris are closely monitoring the outcomes of this summit, acknowledging the potential for a renewed alliance between France and West Germany. Public sentiment in both nations is cautiously optimistic. Many citizens recognize the importance of strong leadership in promoting peace and unity in Europe.

### Conclusion

As Chancellor Kiesinger and President de Gaulle meet at the Élysée Palace, they carry with them the hopes of their respective nations for a cooperative future. The impacts of their discussions will undoubtedly echo throughout Europe, shaping the political landscape for years to come.

This summit is a critical step forward in addressing not only the subdued tensions of the past but also the opportunities that lie ahead for a united Europe.

"# Escape to the Shore: New Yorkers Flock to Connecticut’s Charming Coastal Towns

**By [Your Name]**  
**October 23, 2023**

As autumn sets in and the hustle and bustle of city life continues unabated, New Yorkers are increasingly seeking solace and respite along the serene coasts of Connecticut. Among the historic towns that have captured the hearts of city dwellers is a gem located at the easternmost point of the state—a coastal haven known for its picturesque shoreline, rich history, and charming 18th- and 19th-century homes.

## A Historical Retreat

Connecticut’s easternmost shoreline town, often referred to as Old Lyme, has long been a destination for those looking to escape the frenetic energy of New York City. With its roots stretching back to the colonial era, Old Lyme was officially settled in 1665. The town is characterized by its well-preserved colonial architecture, which reflects its historical significance and offers a glimpse into the past. 

### Architectural Highlights

Walking through the streets of Old Lyme is akin to stepping back in time. The town boasts an eclectic mix of Georgian and Federal-style homes, many of which have been meticulously restored. Notable buildings include the Florence Griswold Museum, once the home of influential American Impressionist artists and a pivotal site in the development of American art in the late 19th century. The intimate galleries and quaint gardens serve as a testament to the town's artistic legacy.

## A Coastal Lifestyle

Beyond its historical allure, Old Lyme presents a relaxed coastal lifestyle that appeals to those seeking refuge from their urban routines. The town's pristine beaches, such as the popular Hains Park, are perfect for leisurely strolls, picnics, and sunset watching, while the calming sounds of the surf provide a therapeutic backdrop to a day's relaxation. 

### Outdoor Activities

For the more adventurous, Old Lyme offers ample opportunities for outdoor activities. Kayaking along the Connecticut River or exploring nearby state parks provides a refreshing way to reconnect with nature. The town's proximity to the historical Connecticut River Valley also opens doors to hiking and fishing, enhancing its appeal as an outdoor sanctuary.

## A Culinary Destination

No escape would be complete without indulging in the local cuisine. Old Lyme has attracted a variety of restaurants and cafes that reflect both the region's coastal bounty and its historical influences. Dining options range from upscale seafood establishments serving freshly caught fare to charming cafes where locals gather for coffee and pastries. The annual Lobster Festival further emphasizes the town's reputation as a culinary destination, attracting visitors from both near and far.

## The Allure of Community

What truly sets Old Lyme apart is its tight-knit community. With a population that boasts a rich tapestry of artists, writers, and professionals, the town fosters a sense of connection and belonging that resonates with newcomers and visitors alike. Frequent community events, art exhibits, and farmers' markets invite participation and enhance the local culture, making it easy for newcomers to feel at home.

### Seasonal Events and Festivals

Throughout the year, Old Lyme hosts a variety of seasonal events, from fall harvest festivals to summer arts fairs, allowing visitors and locals to engage with each other while celebrating the town's vibrant culture.

## Conclusion: A Sanctuary Just Beyond the City

For New Yorkers seeking solace from the relentless pace of city life, Connecticut’s easternmost shoreline town remains an enduring refuge. With its rich history, stunning coastline, and vibrant community, Old Lyme welcomes visitors with open arms, offering a perfect blend of relaxation and cultural enrichment. As autumn unfolds, it beckons city dwellers to leave the concrete jungle behind and immerse themselves in a world where time slows down, and simplicity reigns supreme.

SUBJECT: Final Report Commander's Inquiry into the TF on 18 July 2016 IVO Manbij, Syria 

1. (S) I was appointed on 21 July 2016 as an Investigating Officer for a Commander's Inquiry pursuant to Army Regulation 15-6. The purpose of the inquiry was to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the possible CIVCAS resulting from a Task Force (0)(1)1.7(e) kinetic strike on 18 July 2016, in the vicinity of Manbij, Syria. 

2. (S) Overview. My investigation revealed that while the claim of CIVCAS is credible, the numbers reported on social media (claims of 85-160 killed) are not credible. Given the uncertainty of the precise number of civilians in the target area pre-strike and the movement of civilians in the area post-strike, it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of wounded or killed, however, post-strike analysis and SDF source reporting suggests that between 7 and 24 civilians may have been killed. In the course of my investigation, I found no negligence by any member of TF (b)(1)1.7(e) | Despite this incident, the policies, procedures and practices used during kinetic strikes are sufficient for continued operations. 

3. (U) Findings. I make the following findings based on a preponderance of the evidence after thoroughly reviewing all of the enclosed exhibits with specific regard to the following questions:

"# New Insights Unearthed: Pentagon's Confidential Assessments of Civilian Casualties in Iraq and Syria

**By [Your Name] | [Date]**

In a revealing development, a confidential document from the Pentagon has surfaced, shedding light on civilian casualties resulting from U.S.-led airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. This document, part of a collection of sensitive assessments, specifically examines the human cost of a 2016 airstrike in Syria. The implications of these findings are profound, prompting renewed debates over military operations and their impact on innocent lives.

## Background

The U.S. military has been conducting airstrikes in Iraq and Syria since 2014 as part of its campaign against the Islamic State (ISIS). While the primary goal has been to dismantle a formidable terrorist organization, the unintended fallout of these operations on civilian populations has raised serious ethical, legal, and humanitarian questions. Over the years, numerous reports have emerged indicating that civilian lives have often been caught in the crossfire, complicating the narrative of a “clean” and effective military conflict.

## The 2016 Airstrike Assessment

The document in question provides an in-depth assessment of a specific airstrike conducted in Syria in 2016. According to the assessment, the airstrike targeted a suspected ISIS compound but resulted in civilian casualties, raising significant concerns about the accuracy and intelligence used in executing such operations.

### Key Findings

1. **Civilian Impact**: The assessment documents the number of civilian casualties directly attributed to the airstrike, highlighting the tragic and often overlooked repercussions of military actions. Eyewitness accounts and subsequent investigations revealed that civilians, including women and children, were among the fatalities.

2. **Intelligence Reliability**: The analysis underscores the scrutiny of intelligence reports that warranted the airstrike. It questions the methods employed in gathering actionable intelligence and suggests that lapses in verification contributed to the tragic outcome.

3. **Response and Accountability**: The document also reflects on the military's protocols for responding to civilian casualties. While there are established mechanisms for addressing such incidents, the efficacy of these measures remains in question. Critics argue that there is a systemic failure to hold accountable those responsible for decisions that lead to civilian harm.

4. **Policy Implications**: The findings of this assessment are likely to have broader implications for U.S. military policy and engagement strategies in conflict zones. As the fog of war continues to obscure the truth, the need for greater transparency and accountability is becoming increasingly urgent.

## The Broader Context

The release of this assessment not only adds to the existing body of evidence regarding civilian casualties in conflict zones but also invigorates calls for reform in how military operations are conducted. Human rights organizations and advocacy groups have been vocal in their demands for a reevaluation of U.S. engagement strategies, urging for a shift toward more stringent measures designed to protect innocent lives.

Additionally, this document may reignite debates within the government and among military leaders concerning the ethical implications of airstrikes in densely populated areas. Policymakers are now tasked with balancing military objectives with humanitarian considerations more than ever before.

## Conclusion

The leaked Pentagon assessment detailing civilian casualties from a 2016 airstrike in Syria serves as a vital reminder of the human costs of armed conflict. As the U.S. navigates its role in international military actions, ensuring the protection of civilians must become an imperative consideration. Transparency, accountability, and a commitment to ethical warfare are essential as the nation grapples with the legacy of its military engagements in the Middle East.

The revelations captured in this document underscore a critical moment in military and foreign policy—one that requires reflection, reform, and dedication to safeguarding human lives amid the complexities of combat.

The Fine Line
If running faster…
means jumping higher…
why does the world champion run so slow?
The last great innovation in the high jump was Dick Fosbury’s backwards flop.
Mr. Fosbury — once he hit on it, there’s not a whole lot of things that have adjusted or changed since then.”
Now, all these years later, jumpers are still tweaking the method.For Derek Drouin and his coach, it’s about running slow to control the takeoff.
Here’s why it works.
To prepare for takeoff, Drouin reaches far with his right leg.
When he lands, the horizontal energy converts to vertical energy for takeoff.
By running more slowly, he can keep his leg joint rigid at takeoff. If his leg bends, he'll waste energy.
You see jumpers try to run as fast as they can, and then they put their foot down, and their leg isn’t able to handle it, so they end up just blowing through the bar.”
To keep energy from escaping, he stays as rigid as a stick.
Any bending gives the energy time to escape, because the joints must straighten again before takeoff.
He’s actually very inflexible, which is inherent to him jumping the way that he does.”

Drouin combines his slower run with other critical elements — his path, arm swing and a slightly arched back — to clear a bar nearly eight feet high.
Let's look at his running path.
Running along a curve puts him in a good jumping position.

The curve allows him to lean away from the bar, creating the proper launch angle to clear it.

Here's how Drouin uses his arms.
He swings them back to create more power for his final stride.
His left arm will reach high, guiding his body skyward.

Once you take off the ground, your point of motion is kind of already set. So before I even take off I've already got that left arm up that is hopefully gonna guide me over the bar.”
When his shoulder clears the bar, he drops it on the other side.
Some jumpers arch their backs much more to get extra height. But it's difficult to time and results in more misses.
Drouin stays relatively rigid, arching his back just enough to lift his hips.
Once I’m actually on my mark and I’m about to jump, everything sorta just gets blacked out except for myself and the mat.”

"## If Running Faster Means Jumping Higher, Why Does the World Champion Run So Slow?

When we think of athletic prowess, we often equate speed with agility and power. In the realm of track and field, the relationship between running speed and jumping ability raises intriguing questions. Specifically, if running faster can lead to increased vertical leap, why do some world champions in events like the long jump or triple jump often exhibit relatively slow sprinting times compared to their peers? This article delves into the science behind speed, technique, and athletic specialization to uncover the complexities of these athletic phenomena.

### The Physics of Speed and Jumping

At first glance, it seems logical to assume that a sprinter’s speed directly correlates to their jumping capabilities. The physics behind jumping involves converting horizontal velocity into vertical lift. According to biomechanics, the higher the speed at takeoff, the greater the potential for a vertical leap. This basic principle leads to the intuitive notion that faster runners would naturally be better jumpers.

However, this viewpoint oversimplifies the relationship. Jumping is not solely a function of horizontal speed. The technique, timing, and body mechanics involved in the jump play equally crucial roles. For instance, elite jumpers expend significant effort in optimizing their takeoff angles and body posture to maximize height rather than simply relying on speed.

### The Role of Technique and Specialization

World-class athletes often specialize in one discipline, honing their skills to achieve peak performance within that specific context. The best jumpers may not be the fastest sprinters because they focus primarily on the mechanics of jumping rather than sprinting. Their training emphasizes strength, muscle coordination, and explosive power, which are critical to maximizing their vertical takeoff.

Take the example of **Christian Taylor**, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump. His mastery in this discipline comes not just from sprinting fast down the runway but from intricate footwork, precise timing, and impeccable technique that allow him to leverage his strength for optimal jump performance. While he can sprint effectively, his specialty in jumping means that he doesn’t need to clock the fastest times on the track.

### The Limits of Speed in Specialty Events

Furthermore, specialized track events place different physiological demands on athletes. Short-distance sprinters train differently from jumpers and middle-distance runners. Those competing in the long jump, for instance, aim for balance between speed and technique; when running too quickly, they may sacrifice their jumping mechanics, leading to less than optimal performance. 

Additionally, elite jumpers may prioritize their energy and stamina in ways that allow them to conserve power for more explosive moments, rather than scoring perfect sprinting times. It’s a strategic decision that highlights the difference in training goals between sprinters and jumpers, which can sometimes result in slower recorded speeds for athletes who excel in jumping events.

### The Mental Aspect of Competition

Another important factor to consider is the mental aspect of an athlete's performance. World-class competitors often experience psychological pressures that can impact their speed and execution. The ability to focus solely on technique during critical moments, while mitigating the risks of injury, can lead some jumpers to adopt a more controlled approach. Slower approaches may seem counterintuitive but can enable athletes to concentrate fully on achieving the perfect jump.

**Malaika Mihambo**, the reigning world champion in long jumping, exemplifies this mental balancing act. In competitions, Mihambo demonstrates a focused approach, combining her speed with technique without exceeding her limits. Her training regime emphasizes jump-specific drills over sprinting, allowing her to concentrate on mastering her form.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the relationship between running speed and jumping ability is a multifaceted one that defies simple equations. While faster running typically aids in achieving greater jump heights, elite jumpers optimize their performance through technique, specialty training, and mental focus rather than pure sprinting speed. As sports science continues to evolve, it becomes clearer that success in athletics is determined by a delicate balance of speed, skill, and strategy—factors that vary greatly across different disciplines within the world of track and field. 

As we celebrate the achievements of champion athletes, let us embrace the complexity of their paths, recognizing that success is not solely defined by speed but by the mastery of the art of their respective sports.",ai,"If running faster means jumping higher, why does the world champion run so slow?"

Five leaders in creative fields share their favorite places to eat, drink, shop and play.Related Article
In London, a true world capital, expats weave the fabric of the city as much as the Brits. Still, it’s the longtime London veterans — like the five here — who remain the best guides to the city, from posh Mayfair to the rapidly gentrified corners of the East End.
Libby Sellers•Skye Gyngell•Tracey Emin•Camilla Guinness•Lady Leshurr
Dover Street Market
“I’ve long been a fan of Comme des Garçons and their associate brands, so this five-story emporium is my Mecca (and the carrot cake inRose Bakeryon the top floor is second to none).”17 - 18 Dover St.,doverstreetmarket.com.
Rochelle Canteen
“Within the red-bricked Victorian splendor of the former Rochelle School, the canteen is an oasis in trendy Shoreditch. Chefs Melanie Arnold and Margot Henderson’s restaurant attracts discerning locals, all looking to indulge in the seasonal menus,” Sellers says, referencing simple yet perfected roast chicken and lamb. “Note though, it’s only open for lunch during the week and has no alcohol license (though will happily open any bottles you may bring).”Rochelle School, Arnold Circus,arnoldandhenderson.com.
Jasper Morrison Shop
“Adjoining Jasper Morrison’s atelier is the furniture and product designer’s own outlet, which stocks both his own designs — for the likes of houseware label Alessi and lighting company Flos — alongside everyday yet unique finds he sources from around the globe (though primarily Japan). It’s impossible to leave without making a purchase.”24 Kingsland Rd.,jaspermorrison.com.
Dukes Bar
“It was the bar at Dukes Hotel in St. James that James Bond’s creator Ian Fleming was stirred — not shaken — to create his iconic cocktail. Today, Dukes’ head bartender, Alessandro Palazzi, still makes the best martinis in London and always (only) with lemons allegedly imported from Amalfi just that day.”35 St. James Pl.,dukeshotel.com.
The Beaumont Hotel
“You have to hand it to restaurateurs (and now hoteliers) Jeremy King and Chris Corbin for commissioning an Antony Gormley sculpture as an architectural extension to the facade of this Mayfair hotel. The interior of Gormley’s ‘sitting-man’ sculpture also acts as one of the hotel guest rooms, while the property’s bar feels straight out of an early 20th-century novel. And the restaurant serves an excellent ice cream sundae.”8 Balderton St.,thebeaumont.com.
The furniture floor at Harrods
“While you can no longer buy an elephant at Harrods, the great loss of their pet store has been significantly abated by the radical overhaul of their interiors and home department. With exclusive furniture brands and first-to-market retail concepts, Harrods has reclaimed its reputation for world-class offerings.”87 - 135 Brompton Rd.,harrods.com.
Barbican Centre
“This is a Brutalist beauty and an entirely immersive arts venue. Alongside its gallery, theater and cinema, it’s also home to the Michael Clark Company — the dance company founded by the iconoclastic choreographer and dancer in 1984 — of which I am a patron, so the Barbican earns quite a bit of cred for supporting the unorthodox.”Silk St.,barbican.org.uk.
Gelupo
“I get delicious gelato at Gelupo,” Gyngell says of this Soho dessert spot, which sits across the street from from the popular, buzzy Italian restaurant Bocca. “The sour cherry and ricotta is one of my favorite treats in London.”7 Archer St.,gelupo.com.
Violet Cakes
In East London’s Hackney neighborhood, Gyngell frequents this bakery owned by pastry chef and Alice Waters protégéeClaire Ptak. “Violet Cakes is full of beautiful and seasonal baked goods,” Gyngell says. “Claire spent a long time working at Chez Panisse and her commitment to using only the best seasonal produce shines through.”47 Wilton Way,violetcakes.com.
Spa Terminus
“Coming here is my favorite thing to do on a lovely sunny Saturday morning. It’s my preferred place to shop,” Gyngell says, referring to this former train depot in Bermondsey that’s now a center for food producers and wholesalers, many of which open to the public on weekends. “Visit the Ham & Cheese Company, Neal’s Yard Dairy, La Grotta Ices and Monmouth for a cup of coffee.”Dockley Road Industrial Estate, Dockley Rd.,spa-terminus.co.uk.
Postcard Teas
“Off New Bond Street, near Oxford Circus, this beautiful little shop is a Mecca for all those who love really good tea. They supply our tea at Spring, and I often drop in when I’m in the area to see what new delicacies they may have.”9 Dering St.,postcardteas.com.
The Fumoir at Claridge’s
“This is my favorite bar in London,” Gyngell says of this glamorous, clubby watering hole within the city’s most revered luxury hotel, and with a menu of rare champagnes and wines. “It’s tiny and very elegant — and the coziest place I know to catch up with friends.”49 Brook St.,claridges.co.uk.
Smoking Goat
Soho’s the Smoking Goat is a casual Thai restaurant and one of Gyngell’s regular stops. “I drop in here sometimes on my way home from work. They have a tiny menu — no more than three or four dishes — and it’s all great, perfect for when I feel like something really hot and fiery.”7 Denmark St.,smokinggoatsoho.com.
La Fromagerie
“I think this has to be my favorite place for Sunday brunch. It’s opposite the Marylebone Farmers market. The owner, Patricia Michelson, is one of the most knowledgeable cheesemongers in London. I always order the boiled eggs and toasted sourdough.”2 - 6 Moxon St.,lafromagerie.co.uk.
Old Spitalfields Market
“The area in which I live is and always has been famous for its markets. Every Thursday there’s a flea market inOld Spitalfields,” Emin says, referring to the Thursday Antique and Vintage Flea Market that specializes in antiques and vintage wares of every kind, from furniture to William Morris prints. “I like to look around for inspiration for my work and for Edwardian pornography, which I collect.”Horner Square,oldspitalfieldsmarket.com.
Spitalfields City Farm
“Even though I live in the city, I fantasize about one day having a farm. Until that happens, I visit City Farm, about a five minute walk from my home. Amidst the railway lines and surrounded by the urban landscape, it’s a functioning farm with lots of animals and crops. It very sweet and relaxing and it smells of nature.”Buxton St.,spitalfieldscityfarm.org.
Wright Brothers
“When I am away from London one of the things I miss the most are the restaurants.Locally, in Spitalfields I love Wright Brothers, which supplies most of London’s best restaurants with oysters. They also have amazing fish!”8a Lamb St., Old Spitalfields Market,thewrightbrothers.co.uk.
Tramshed
“One of my best friends is the chef Mark Hix and I’m a regular at all his establishments,” Emin says. Tramshed, Hix’s meat-heavy Shoreditch restaurant, is housed in a former electrical generator station. “London is amazing for eating out and it’s incredible how much the scene has changed over the last 20 years. A lot of the good restaurants in London also have very good art on the walls.” Case in point: a huge Damien Hirst formaldehyde sculpture of a cow and chicken that acts as Tramshed’s centerpiece.32 Rivington St.,chickenandsteak.co.uk.
Tate Britain
“I love walking along the Thames Embankment on a mini pilgrimage to look at British art,” Emin says. Currently, Emin’s installation, “My Bed,” is on display alongside six of the artist’s recent figure drawings, which are shown with two Francis Bacon oil paintings she personally selected. “I have to pinch myself every time I go.”Millbank,tate.org.uk.
Serpentine Galleries
In Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, the two contemporary art spaces that make up the Serpentine Galleries (five minutes’ walk from one another), “must be one of the best located galleries in the world,” Emin says. “They’re smack bang right in the middle of the park. Go for a picnic. Lay out in the sun and see some art.”Kensington Gardens and West Carriage Dr.,serpentinegalleries.org.
Wellcome Collection
“There’s a huge collection of weird and wonderful medical curiosities here, with one of the world’s biggest libraries housing the progress of medicine as well as state-of-the-art installations, art and interactive games relating to illnesses. It’s laid out like a modern art museum and has a fantastic bookshop full of volumes on the strangest subjects.”183 Euston Rd.,wellcomecollection.org.
The South Bank and National Theatre
“This is an all-in-one experience. I don’t like to do one without the other. I take the tube to Embankment and walk across the Waterloo Bridge with its spectacular views of London on either side. Taking in the South Bank is all part of the pleasure of visiting the National Theatre, where whatever you see is usually bound to be good — and if not, I am happy to spend hours in the bookshop and walk back over the bridge again.”Upper Ground, South Bank,nationaltheatre.org.uk.
Lassco
“I love this reclamation venue under the arches in Bermondsey. Old floorboards, industrial lights, door knobs, old bathtubs and general architectural salvage can all be found here amidst their workshops, cafes and even a bakery. They have another location at Brunswick House which has a fabulous restaurant.”41 Maltby St.,lassco.co.uk.
The Wolseley
“My favorite restaurant in London has an old European grandeur and glamour, serving old fashioned entrees like soufflé Suisse and croustade of quail eggs with hollandaise (though there are plenty of less fattening things, too). This is where I would like to be buried. Nothing to fault except perhaps the acoustics when it is very busy, which is always.”160 Piccadilly,thewolseley.com.
Marianna Kennedy
“This shop in Shoreditch is where the genius designer Marianna Kennedy can be found amongst her jewel-colored resin lamps, blue-and-pink Mercury mirrors and little lacquer tables. The space is an extraordinary example of how you can adhere strictly to tradition in wall, window and floor finishes while turning classical objects around using new materials to create a restrained — though not minimalist — beauty. This is really worth visiting for anyone interested in design.”3 Fournier St.,mariannakennedy.com.
Electric Cinema
“In Notting Hill, this is no ordinary cinema experience. There are plush red velvet armchairs and little side tables with brasserie lights. Food and cocktails are brought to you and there’s even a cashmere blanket for each guest, which I don’t want to admit to liking as it sounds a bit naff, but it’s impossible to resist wrapping myself in it.”191 Portobello Rd.,electriccinema.co.uk.
Cambio de Tercio
“If someone I don’t know very well suggests dinner here, I know we’ll be friends,” Guinness says of this tapas restaurant in South Kensington. “The food is modern Spanish, in the sense that Spain seems to have spawned some incredibly inventive chefs. The food is delicious and creative but unpretentious.”163 Old Brompton Rd.,cambiodetercio.co.uk.
Lights of Soho
“This is a great venue for hanging out,” Leshurr says of this new social hub — part members’ club, part gallery and bar made for the creatives of London’s Soho neighborhood. “It has the best neon art collection in the world, and there is always something going on. One day there will be a nude poetry reading. The next, you’ll see singer Sam Smith doing a shoot for GQ.”35 Brewer St.,lightsofsoho.com.
The Lounge, Odeon Whiteleys
Adding to the increasing list of high-end moviegoing experiences around the world’s major cities, the Lounge at Odeon Whiteleys, in a shopping center in West London, is one that Leshurr visits often. “It’s a luxury cinema with an intimate feeling. There are a selection of fantastic seasonal cocktails and meals that are served to you during the film.”151 Queensway,odeon.co.uk.
The Prince of Wales
“Prince of Wales is owned by Ray Davies, one of the members of the band The Kinks,” Leshurr says of this casual pub in Highgate, where locals stop in for a pint after work — and which hosts a popular Tuesday evening quiz night. “It’s got a chilled vibe.”53 Highgate High St., 020-8340-0445.
10 Greek Street
A tiny, popular spot in Soho, 10 Greek Street is, according to Leshurr, “a restaurant where you never know what will be on the menu, as it changes daily.” Consistently packed since its opening a little over two years ago, the eatery doesn’t take reservations, but it’s worth making it through the dinnertime crush for the Mediterranean-influenced entrees like a truffled Jerusalem artichoke tart. And while you’re here, “make sure you ask for their secret wine list,” Leshurr says.10 Greek St.,10greekstreet.com.
Golborne Road Market

Merritt Wever on the ‘Nurse Jackie’ Series Finale and Zoey’s Final Line
Spoilers for Sunday’s “Nurse Jackie” series finale follow.

The last time Edie Falco was in a series finale, viewers were left hanging over the fate of her TV husband, Tony Soprano. This time, it was her turn, as the title character in Showtime’s “Nurse Jackie”
                                        wrapped her seven-season run lying on a hospital floor after having apparently overdosed on drugs. Whether she lives or dies isn’t clear.
“I don’t think all shows need to have a wrapped-up ending,” said Merritt Wever, who starred alongside Ms. Falco as ebullient nurse Zoey Barkow. “But I thought this was an honest, appropriate
                                        and somehow satisfying ending. That’s the most you can hope for.”
Ms. Wever discussed the finale, which included the surprise reappearance of Jackie’s best friend, Dr. Eleanor O’Hara (Eve Best, who left the series in 2013). These are edited excerpts of the conversation.
What was the mood like on the set during the final season?
Over the course of the season, it wasn’t like everybody was morose. We were all very grateful, honestly. But the last few days were really sad.
In the scene when Zoey says goodbye to Jackie, were any of those tears real, or was it all just masterful acting?
There was probably a little bit of both, to be honest. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t overwhelmed. I remember going home after that and realizing that was the last time I was going to get to act with
                                        Edie — how amazing it was that was part of my life for so long but just how much I was going to miss it. That never got old or lost its luster.
How was it having Tony Shalhoub join the cast for the last season?
It was great. He’s a lovely presence and actor to have around every day. I was really glad he got to be a part of the show, even at the tail end. And I liked how the writers had so many endings happening simultaneously
                                        during the last season: the hospital closing, Coop (Peter Facinelli) leaving, and Tony’s character losing his life. I thought that was appropriate.
What did you make of your final line, “You’re good, Jackie. You’re good”? Do you see a double meaning?
Yeah. In the first episode, Jackie said, “Make me good, God. But not yet.” In my mind, Jackie doesn’t make it. I think the ending is honest. And I’m glad that it’s not my responsibility
                                        to figure out what happens after the lights go out.
Have you given any thought to what happens with Zoey? The last we hear, she’s heading to Haiti to work with Doctors Without Borders.
I thought that was a lovely idea. She’ll always love Jackie and she’ll miss her a lot. That’s all I know about her future.
Why did she feel like she needed to break away from Jackie? Did she need to find her own path, or did she know on some level Jackie would never get clean?
It’s hard when you’re used to playing certain roles with somebody to break out of that emotionally. In the last season, Zoey had a hard time doing that in this new position professionally. I don’t
                                        see her ever being able to fully remove herself from that. And all good things must come to an end.
What did you think about Zoey’s evolution as a character? It’s mentioned that she started out in bunny scrubs and ended up as head nurse.
I was lucky that in the pilot, she shows up and she’s brand new. She had a long way to travel. I was glad she never lost her enthusiasm, confidence and zest for life. The writers were able to keep those things
                                        and still have her mature in her life.
So you were satisfied with the way it ended?
I was hoping I would be able to experience all the gratefulness without any of the sadness of having it end. That didn’t really work out. I loved Zoey so much, and the writers and Edie were so good to me. The
                                        only downside is that it may be the best job of my life. It’s all downhill from here.
Did you take home any mementoes from the set?
I took home my ID badge. The picture was taken on the first day of the pilot. I’m all fresh-faced, and I’m actually wearing the bunny scrubs. I’ve had the same badge since Day 1, so it’s
                                        pretty weathered.
What’s next for you as an actress? Would you do another TV series right away?
I don’t know. One of the great things about doing a TV show is you have a bit of stability for a while. Actors are freelancers. Now I’m plunged back into not knowing where my next job is coming from, and
                                        that’s a terrifying existence.
Couldn’t it also be exhilarating?
Yes, but I’m not a born optimist.
Unlike Zoey?
Very unlike Zoey.
That’s a testament to your acting ability.
I’ll take it.

"**Title: Lights Out: Insights from Ms. Wever on The Uncertainty of Life Beyond the Screen**

**By [Your Name]**  
*October 20, 2023*

In an exclusive interview, the multidimensional talent Ms. Wever, renowned for her remarkable portrayal in the Emmy-nominated Showtime series, shared her profound reflections on the complexities of life both on and off the set. Amidst her busy filming schedule, Wever emphasized a sentiment that resonates with many: “I’m glad that it’s not my responsibility to figure out what happens after the lights go out.”

### A Moment of Reflection

Wever's comments came during a candid discussion about the pressures and expectations that accompany an acting career. As an artist, she often grapples with the balance between her on-screen persona and her private life. The notion of ""after the lights go out"" can be interpreted in various ways — from the literal conclusion of a filming day to the metaphorical uncertainties that life presents.

“It’s a freeing thought,” Wever continued, elaborating on the idea that as a performer, her role is to give life to characters without the burden of deciding their ultimate fates. “We, as actors, present stories, but the audience ultimately engages with those narratives in their own ways. We’re here to ignite discussions, not close chapters.”

### The Weight of Expectations

In an era when the lines between celebrity and reality blur, the expectation for actors to have all the answers—whether about their characters or societal issues—can be daunting. Wever’s perspective serves as a refreshing reminder that vulnerability and uncertainty are part of the human condition, extending beyond the silver screen.

The Showtime series in which Wever stars has touched upon themes of existentialism and moral ambiguity. Audiences have resonated with these narratives, grappling with their own interpretations and conclusions. For Wever, this engagement signifies a success; she hopes her performance inspires viewers to reflect on their realities rather than wait for definitive answers.

### Crafting Characters with Complexity

As Ms. Wever delves deeper into her character’s complexities, she acknowledges the paradox of her profession: “We create these multi-layered individuals who experience conflict and resolution, but often, we don’t provide the neat wrap-up that people crave.” This sentiment echoes in numerous works of drama, where the story doesn’t end with a traditional resolution, leaving characters—and viewers—forever altered.

In her role, Wever poses difficult questions rather than providing clear solutions. This aligns with the current cultural climate, where audiences are increasingly inclined toward narratives that reflect the unpredictability of real life.

### Conclusion: Embracing the Unknown

“I’m glad that it’s not my responsibility to figure out what happens after the lights go out,” is not just a statement about acting but a broader commentary on life itself. As Ms. Wever continues to navigate the intricacies of her craft, she invites her audience to join her in embracing the unknown, illustrating that perhaps the journey, with all its uncertainties, is where true fulfillment lies.

In this unpredictable landscape of storytelling and existence, Ms. Wever stands as a beacon of authenticity, encouraging a dialogue that transcends the screen—one that invites contemplation over resolution, and a deeper understanding of the human experience.

Music and Clowns
What I wish people understood about having a family member with Down syndrome.
Do you know that — Mm. — you’re a complete mystery to me. I don’t know what you’re thinking. Mm, mm. Can you give me a clue? Queen. You were thinking about the queen? Mm. O.K. How do you feel about me — Mm. — making a film about you? [LAUGHS] You just kissed my microphone. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can you help me introduce the characters in the film? So what’s your name? Jamie. And what’s my name? Clown. I’m not a clown. Here’s some family photos. Show me who you can see. Who’s that? Mummy. And who’s that there? Who’s that at the end? That’s Daddy. Daddy. Who’s that? Alex. And next to him? D. “No, no.” [LAUGHTER] Who is it? Jamie. That’s right. Mm, mm. What are you doing? Well, it’s my place, sitting over here. Yep. Ready? Steady? What do you imagine he thinks of you? I don’t think he analyzes things at all as you tend to. When I’m stressed or maybe not even known I was stressed, he’s come up to me and just touched my arm. And you can almost feel it draining away. It feels like a lightning conductor, just a small touch. What do you think he’s trying to do? I don’t think he’s trying to do anything. He’s just empathetic. So he understands how you see things. I think he understands how you feel probably better than you do. What he thinks is a mystery to me. I have no idea what’s going on in his head. Maybe nothing is. It could be a total blank. Mm, mm. Mm. But I’ve no idea. I’ve no idea how — what goes on in his head. I mean, he loves food. Anything to do with cooking and food, he’s there like a shot. Because he enjoys his food. But then he hasn’t got that much else in his life really. Music. Music, yes. Oh yes, he likes music. ABBA [MUSIC PLAYING] Mm. And of course, the circus. He’s mad about clowns — The circus. — and the circus. [HORN PLAYING] Do you know where that came from? No, not at all. I mean, he’d obviously like to be a clown. Maybe that’s — hiding behind the mask. I don’t know. No, no, no. I don’t think he wants to be a clown. I think he likes what they portray, which is a nice and simple mime of life. But he’s got the family sense of humor. [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] I just looked at him. I just knew. And that was good, knowing from the beginning. Because I think it’s harder if you think you’ve got a normal child and then find out later that then there’s something wrong with them. So you could sort of grieve all at the beginning really. So it was. It was like a bereavement. You’re grieving for the child that you hoped you’d have instead of which you’ve got this other child. I remember finding out that he got Down syndrome and just holding him and thinking, oh dear, start again. When did your own feelings settle down? No, no. That was just an instant. Clearly life would not be the same without Jamie. He’s a blessing. Yes, I, I — a bit bemused when people hear they’re having Down’s children and only see the negative side. But there are lots of positive sides. There’s a video of Jamie and Guy playing recorders. And he’s about 6 maybe, and he’s full of energy. And that slowly, slowly diminished. I feel like it correlates with moving out. Yes, it does actually. Because that’s the same time he stopped getting any sort of educational programs, even, like, not being around the rest of the family. Yeah, no, you’re right. It did change him. We worry about the future of how he will cope when we’re dead. So our plan was to find somewhere, which we have. He’s got to get used to the place. And then we’ll disappear, and it won’t be quite so bad. The impact is that carers are paid to do things for him. So he no longer talks or does things for himself because he doesn’t need to. Yeah, no, you’re right. But you never know. You can only do what you think is best at the time. And really, you can’t regret what you do. What’s your plan for Jamie in the future in terms of living? I found an institution, a charity that provides housing and all sorts of things. So I don’t want to put that guilt onto any of my children. But I just hope they would look after him. I know people get busy lives and forget. But I should hate to think of him in his own little world and then none of his siblings taking an interest. We’re all quite spread out now. We are, yeah. But that’s irrelevant. O.K. I feel like I’m being told off. [LAUGHTER] You are, you are. [MUSIC PLAYING]

"**What I Wish People Understood About Having a Family Member with Down Syndrome**

*By [Your Name]*  
*Published: [Date]*

Having a family member with Down syndrome can be one of life's most rewarding experiences, yet it also comes with unique challenges and misconceptions. Through love, patience, and understanding, families navigate a journey that is often underappreciated by society. Here are important insights that I wish people would understand about living with a family member who has Down syndrome.

### 1. **Each Person is Unique**

First and foremost, it's vital to remember that individuals with Down syndrome are just that—individuals. Each person brings their own personality, interests, and talents to the table. Generalizations about capabilities or behaviors can be harmful. Families not only cherish the unique traits of their loved ones but also advocate for their recognition and respect as individuals.

### 2. **The Misconceptions of Limitations**

One of the most prevalent misconceptions is that individuals with Down syndrome have limited potential. Contrary to this belief, many thrive in various environments, including educational, vocational, and social settings. With the right support and resources, they can achieve academic success, hold meaningful jobs, and lead active lives. Advocacy for inclusive programs is crucial.

### 3. **Support Systems Matter**

Families often invest significant time and resources in navigating the systems that support their loved ones. From accessing early intervention services to finding suitable schools and supportive workplaces, the journey can be intricate. Understanding that this process is often overwhelming and complex would help foster empathy and support from the community.

### 4. **The Importance of Inclusion**

Inclusion is not merely a buzzword; it is essential. Whether at school, in community activities, or in social settings, having family members with Down syndrome included fosters a culture of acceptance and understanding. It's crucial for peers and the community to actively engage with individuals with Down syndrome, as it nurtures mutual respect and enriches everyone's experience.

### 5. **The Emotional Toll on Families**

Caring for a family member with Down syndrome can come with emotional highs and lows. Families may experience a rollercoaster of feelings, from joy and pride in their loved one’s achievements to worries about their future. Acknowledging the emotional labor involved allows for a deeper understanding of the challenges families face and the support they might need.

### 6. **Community Support Makes a Difference**

For families navigating the complexities of life with a loved one with Down syndrome, community support can make a profound difference. Organizations that provide resources, workshops, and social events create a network of encouragement. Communities that embrace and empower families strengthen the fabric of society.

### 7. **Celebrating Achievements, Large and Small**

Every milestone matters. Whether it’s a small step in personal development or a significant accomplishment, families take immense pride in every achievement. Celebrating these moments fosters positivity and inspires continued growth, not only for the individual with Down syndrome but for the entire family.

### Conclusion

Having a family member with Down syndrome is not about limitations but rather about possibilities. By fostering understanding, empathy, and inclusion, we can create a more supportive society. It is essential for everyone to recognize the beauty and challenges that come with this unique experience—appreciating it for what it truly is: a journey filled with love, growth, and incredible moments.

Maps Show Where Bloomberg Aides Thought He Would Be Competitive

Michael Bloomberg Says He Won’t Run for President",human,The maps that Michael R. Bloomberg's aides used internally to guide their thinking about how he would affect the presidential race.
"# The Maps Behind the Decision: How Michael R. Bloomberg's Aides Analyzed His Impact on the Presidential Race

In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made headlines with his late entry into the Democratic primary. As Bloomberg's team strategized about his potential impact, they relied on a complex and comprehensive series of internal maps. These tools provided a crucial visual representation of not only where he would campaign but also how his candidacy could influence voter demographics and electoral outcomes across the United States.

## The Purpose of the Maps

Bloomberg's aides utilized these maps to glean insights into key battleground states, projecting how his presence in the race would sway votes. By analyzing demographic data, historical voting patterns, and polling results, the maps served multiple purposes:

1. **Identifying Key States**: The maps highlighted critical states for Democratic success, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These swing states were pivotal in determining the outcome of the election and became focal points for Bloomberg's campaign efforts.

2. **Understanding Voter Demographics**: Each map was layered with detailed demographic information. Bloomberg's advisors assessed voter preferences across various groups—age, ethnicity, income levels, and urban versus rural divides—which allowed the team to tailor their outreach strategies accordingly.

3. **Projecting Electoral Outcomes**: The internal maps also included electoral projections based on hypothetical matchups against key candidates like Joe Biden and Donald Trump. This data allowed Bloomberg's team to strategize not only for the primary but also for a potential general election candidacy.

## Strategic Insights Gained

Through the mapping analyses, Bloomberg’s aides derived several strategic insights that informed their campaign decisions:

- **Cultivating Support in Diverse Communities**: The maps revealed the necessity of engaging different demographic groups. For instance, targeting urban communities and minority voters became a crucial part of Bloomberg's strategy, given their disproportionate influence in Democratic primaries.

- **Impact of Media and Messaging**: With maps illustrating the regions most responsive to advertising and media campaigns, Bloomberg's aides were able to craft specific messages tailored to diverse audiences, emphasizing issues that resonated on both local and national levels.

- **Resource Allocation**: The visual data highlighted where to concentrate campaign resources, from financial investment in advertising to boots-on-the-ground volunteer efforts, maximizing the efficacy of their outreach.

## Challenges Encountered

Despite the utility of these maps, Bloomberg’s team faced significant challenges. The nuances of voter sentiment could not always be captured visually. Disparities in perception and reaction to Bloomberg's wealth and past policies created a complicated landscape that required adaptation beyond what the maps could predict. Moreover, the rise of progressive candidates like Bernie Sanders drew attention away from Bloomberg, affecting his appeal among younger voters.

## Conclusion: A New Model for Campaign Strategy

The internal maps crafted by Michael R. Bloomberg’s aides exemplify an evolving model of political strategy in the digital age. By integrating data visualization with traditional campaign tactics, Bloomberg's team aimed to chart a course through an unpredictable electoral landscape. While his campaign ultimately did not result in the nomination, the methods employed provide a case study in how data-driven strategies might influence future electoral contests, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and nuanced engagement in political campaigning.

As campaigns continue to embrace technology and data analytics, the legacy of Bloomberg’s maps may resonate as a pivotal point in understanding the intricate dance of modern American politics.",ai,The maps that Michael R.

"# A Smarter Way to Clean Your Home: Innovations to Revolutionize Your Cleaning Routine

## Introduction

Cleaning the home is an essential aspect of maintaining a healthy and pleasant living environment. However, many people find traditional cleaning methods time-consuming and often ineffective. In this age of technology and innovation, a smarter way to clean is emerging, offering efficient solutions that save time, reduce effort, and improve overall cleanliness. This article explores the latest advancements in home cleaning technology, eco-friendly solutions, and smart organization tips to elevate your cleaning routine.

## 1. Embracing Technology

### Robotic Vacuum Cleaners

Among the most significant innovations in home cleaning are robotic vacuum cleaners. Devices such as the Roomba and Roborock go beyond simply vacuuming. They employ advanced mapping technology, allowing them to navigate your home and clean efficiently. Many models can be controlled via smartphone apps, letting you schedule cleanings or activate them while you're away. 

### Smart Cleaning Gadgets

In addition to robotic vacuums, the market is saturated with smart cleaning gadgets that simplify household chores. For instance, automatic window cleaners and self-cleaning mops combine technology and convenience, allowing you to maintain cleanliness with minimal effort. These gadgets are designed to integrate with home automation systems, making it easier to control all your cleaning tasks from a single device.

## 2. Eco-Friendly Cleaning Solutions

### Sustainable Products

As awareness of environmental issues grows, many homeowners are turning to eco-friendly cleaning products. Brands like Seventh Generation and Method produce biodegradable formulations that reduce the chemical footprint left in our homes. These products are not only better for the environment but often safer for your family and pets.

### DIY Cleaning Solutions

Creating your own cleaning products using simple ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils is another effective way to ensure a clean home without harsh chemicals. Not only are DIY solutions budget-friendly, but they also allow you to customize fragrances and properties to suit your preferences.

## 3. The Power of Organization

### Decluttering Techniques

A clean home is often a decluttered home. The KonMari method and other minimalist philosophies encourage homeowners to evaluate what items they truly need and cherish. By reducing clutter, you minimize the surface area that requires cleaning, making maintenance easier and more efficient.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Investing in smart storage solutions—such as clear bins, label makers, and multi-functional furniture—can help streamline organization. Keeping items in designated places reduces the time spent locating cleaning supplies and can inspire a more consistent cleaning routine.

## 4. Creating a Cleaning Schedule

A structured cleaning schedule can enhance efficiency and ensure that all areas of your home receive the attention they need. Divide tasks into daily, weekly, and monthly responsibilities. For example:

- **Daily**: Make the bed, wash dishes, and wipe down counters.
- **Weekly**: Vacuum floors, dust surfaces, and clean bathrooms.
- **Monthly**: Clear out the refrigerator, deep clean carpets, and organize closets.

Using digital tools, such as calendar apps or cleaning management systems, can aid in adhering to this schedule.

## Conclusion

Innovations in technology, eco-friendly products, and smart organizational practices are redefining how we approach home cleaning. By adopting these smarter cleaning methods, homeowners can reduce the time and effort spent on housekeeping tasks while maintaining a healthy and inviting environment. As we continue to discover and implement more efficient cleaning solutions, the future of home maintenance looks brighter than ever. Embrace these changes, and enjoy a cleaner home with less hassle.

"**Title: Return to Angola: Portugal's Economic Shift Sparks Reverse Migration to its Former Colony**

**By [Author Name] | Date: October 15, 2023**

**Introduction**

In recent years, Portugal has faced a series of economic challenges that have caused many of its citizens to reconsider their future at home. This economic downturn has fueled a notable and complex migration trend, leading some Portuguese nationals to return to Angola, the country's former colony and a nation rich in natural resources, particularly oil. This article explores the intricacies of this reversed migration pattern, highlighting how historical dynamics have shifted—now placing Europeans in a subservient role in this burgeoning narrative.

**Background: Economic Turmoil in Portugal**

The Portuguese economy has struggled significantly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, grappling with high inflation, rising unemployment, and stagnant wage growth. The European Central Bank's monetary policies have further complicated recovery efforts, leaving many disillusioned with the prospects of life in Portugal. As opportunities dwindled, a generation of young Portuguese, previously captivated by dreams of stability and prosperity at home, began turning their gaze toward Angola—a land rich with opportunities amid a rapidly changing socio-economic landscape.

**The New Angola: Opportunities Amidst Challenges**

Angola, once considered a tumultuous young nation emerging from decades of civil war, has transformed significantly since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975. With vast reserves of oil and natural resources, Angola has become an attractive destination for investment and employment. The Angolan government, keen on revitalizing its economy and diversifying beyond oil dependence, is making strides to create a more conducive environment for international workers. This new reality is emblematic of Angola's shifting status—an economic landscape that now presents opportunities for returning Portuguese nationals.

**Cultural and Economic Bonds Resurface**

The shared linguistic and cultural ties between Portugal and Angola serve as a crucial bridge for would-be migrants. For many Portuguese, the prospect of working in Angola is more than just an economic decision—it is also a return to familiar cultural landscapes, intertwining familial connections, and shared heritage. In cities like Luanda, Portuguese citizens find themselves reintegrating into societal frameworks where they have familial roots and an understanding of the local culture, but this time as international—not colonial—participants in the economic narrative.

**A Shift in Power Dynamics**

The migration from Portugal to Angola represents a fundamental shift in power dynamics reminiscent of colonial history. Historically, the roles were more straightforward: Portugal, as the colonial power, wielded control and influence over Angola. Today, however, this relationship has evolved dramatically. Angolans are now concerned with correcting historic injustices and asserting their sovereignty, rendering Portuguese nationals less dominant in an economic sense. In this scenario, Europeans are finding themselves in a subservient role, navigating the complexities of a nation once seen primarily as a colony.

**Challenges on the Ground**

Despite the budding opportunities, the return migration to Angola is not without its challenges. Portuguese migrants may encounter cultural differences, bureaucratic hurdles, and the realities of navigating a developing economy with its own diversities and difficulties. Furthermore, the socio-political atmosphere in Angola remains delicate, requiring newcomers to approach their reintegration with sensitivity and respect for local customs and governance.

**Conclusion: A New Era of Migration**

The return of Portuguese citizens to Angola marks a significant transition in the historical narrative between the two nations. As Portugal faces economic challenges and demographic changes, Angola's burgeoning economy presents a unique opportunity for migration. This flow of movement encapsulates not only the resilience of individuals seeking better prospects but also an evolving relationship between two nations learning to navigate their intertwined futures. In this new era, the Europeans, once the colonizers, are now adapting to an African landscape that offers both promise and complexity.

**Call to Action**

As we continue to monitor these dynamic migration trends, it is essential to facilitate understanding and foster dialogue between cultures, ensuring that the future is shaped collaboratively—one that honors both history and the promise of innovation, cooperation, and mutual growth.

"**The Quiet Warriors: An Inside Look at Ukraine’s Paramilitary Frontlines**

*By [Author Name]*  
*Published: [Date]*

As the sun sets over the war-torn landscapes of eastern Ukraine, a shadowy group of fighters remains steadfast at the front lines, asserting a crucial yet contentious role in the ongoing conflict with Russia. The New York Times recently ventured into this precarious territory to uncover the complexities surrounding a paramilitary organization that has taken it upon itself to defend Ukrainian sovereignty against Russian aggression. Despite their palpable presence, Ukrainian government officials deny the legitimacy of these groups, posing an intriguing question: what role do these paramilitaries play in a broader strategy against a resurgent Russia?

### The Paramilitary Landscape

Ukrainian paramilitary groups have emerged in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, evolving from volunteer battalions to organized units engaged in a multifaceted struggle. These groups often fill critical gaps in Ukrainian military capabilities, providing both manpower and specialized skills, as official military resources strain under the conflict’s protracted nature. Many of these fighters are motivated by nationalism, a sense of duty, and personal histories characterized by loss and resistance.

The specific group we accompanied, calling themselves the ""Defenders of Freedom,"" comprises veterans of previous conflicts and civilians alike, trained in guerrilla warfare and urban combat. They claim to have established control over several strategic points in the Donbas region, with a fierce dedication to holding the line against separatist forces backed by Russia. ""We will not leave,"" stated one member, a veteran with scars both visible and invisible. ""As long as the threat exists, we will defend our land.""

### Denial and Disavowal

Despite their active engagement in combat, the Ukrainian government officially disavows these paramilitary units, citing concerns over control and accountability. Government spokespeople have consistently argued that the existence of these groups complicates the national narrative of a unified front in the war against Russia. “They act independently of any structures we have in place,” a senior military official remarked, hinting at both the risks and potential repercussions of such rogue entities.

This disconnection raises a critical issue—how can Ukraine maintain a coherent military strategy when segments of its front lines are operated by unofficial actors? Amidst the chaos of war, the government faces a delicate balancing act between leveraging these paramilitary efforts and avoiding the pitfalls of fragmentation that could arise from unchecked power dynamics.

### The Impact on the Conflict with Russia

The presence of paramilitary groups like the Defenders of Freedom not only influences the immediate battlefield but also shapes the geopolitical landscape of the region. On one hand, these fighters bolster Ukraine's defenses, demonstrating resilience and patriotism at a time when international support remains crucial yet inconsistent. Their intimate knowledge of local geography and deep-rooted connections to the community lend them an advantage against more conventional Russian forces.

Conversely, the existence of these groups introduces significant risks. Paramilitary units often act outside the purview of formal military discipline, leading to potential human rights violations and complications in diplomatic negotiations. The Russian side has seized upon these narratives, framing the situation as a threat to stability and justifying its military actions under the pretense of protecting ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Such narratives resonate globally, complicating Ukraine's appeal for international solidarity and intervention.

### Looking to the Future

As the conflict drags on and the winter months approach, the question of the future role of paramilitary groups becomes increasingly pressing. With unresolved tensions and the risk of escalation, their influence on both military strategy and domestic stability will be pivotal.

Experts argue that for Ukraine to effectively counter the larger Russian threat, a more integrated approach is necessary—one that seeks to incorporate these fighters into a coordinated framework while retaining governmental oversight and accountability. “There is strength in unity, even among diverse forces,” said a military analyst observing the evolving dynamics. “The challenge is to channel that strength constructively.”

As the frontline heats up and the world watches, the fate of these paramilitary groups, the legitimacy of their actions, and their role in the larger conflict with Russia hang in the balance. With their commitment unwavering, they stand as both an embodiment of Ukraine’s resilience and a symbol of the complexities that define contemporary warfare. 

### Conclusion

The New York Times’ journey alongside the Defenders of Freedom sheds light on a dimension of the Ukrainian conflict often cloaked in controversy and denial. As these warriors navigate the complexities of loyalty, legality, and strategy in their fight for their homeland, the geopolitical implications are vast, leaving international observers questioning how far Ukraine can go without a unified front amid the chaos.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.
Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted — “a game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,” as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite — there was only so much cliff — so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.
Harding found all this pompous and ridiculous. A California road surveyor who loved fast cars, he saw climbing as an enjoyable but silly vice and felt no responsibility to anybody. To establish Wall of the Early Morning Light, a 3,000-foot sweep of golden granite, Harding and his partner lived out of hammocks for 27 days and drank cheap wine while pandering to the TV news crews filming them. Worst of all, in Robbins’s view, Harding ascended huge blank sections of rock by drilling more than 300 bolts and then clipping on stirrups to eliminate difficulty and risk.
Robbins craved order, greatness and the confidence that he was doing the right thing. Born in West Virginia in 1935, he suffered early abandonment by his father, also named Royal (“Ah, Dad, why did you leave me?” he wrote in an autobiography titled “To Be Brave”). Then came years of abuse by an alcoholic stepfather named James Chandler, who moved the family to California and changed Robbins’s name to his own. Robbins was 10 when he heard his mother beg his stepfather to put down a knife. Robbins ran for help, Chandler disappeared and Robbins soon reclaimed his birth name and resolved to become a better man than either of his fathers.
He found schoolwork difficult but climbing easy. He first climbed in Yosemite in 1952 at the dawn of the sport’s true golden age, when equipment and techniques were finally mature enough for the biggest walls, but Yosemite’s marquee cliffs remained unclimbed. The obvious first plum was the 2,500-foot northwest face of Half Dome, and when Robbins heard that Harding was planning an attempt, Robbins scrambled a team and, in 1957, got to the top first. Harding retaliated by claiming the first ascent of El Capitan. In 45 days’ work spread over 18 months, Harding created the so-called Nose Route by keeping ropes always fixed from his high point to the ground, commuting up and down with food and wine, drilling countless bolts and basking in national publicity.
Robbins was so disturbed that in 1960 he made the second ascent of the Nose Route in just seven days. A year later, Robbins demonstrated just how retrograde Harding’s methods were by doing his own first ascent of a different route on El Capitan in just 12 days and with very few bolts. The resulting route, called the Salathé Wall, is still perhaps the greatest long rock climb on Earth.
Robbins and Harding kept up their amiable competition — for prestigious first ascents and the soul of the sport — throughout the 1960s. Each time Harding or anyone else established a big new route, Robbins repeated it in better style: faster, sometimes alone, occasionally chopping bolts he deemed unnecessary. When not climbing, Robbins played tennis, read Ralph Waldo Emerson and wrote essays calling at least one of his own climbs “better even than Mozart.” Harding wasn’t the only one who thought Robbins ought to lighten up, but many leading climbers shared Robbins’s belief that first ascents should be done in the most adventurous way possible, with minimal damage to the wall.
So when Harding spent nearly a month drilling his way up Wall of the Early Morning Light in 1970, with constant network-news coverage, Robbins was on firm social footing in declaring the route “contrived and artificial.” A year later, with a partner named Don Lauria, Robbins started up Harding’s opus with hammer and chisel, beginning an operation without precedent in the history of the sport — the deliberate, violent erasure of a major new climb created by an internationally famous climber.
Early on the first day, however, Robbins encountered an unbolted section of surprising technical delicacy. More bolts followed, and Robbins chopped them, but then he found still more dangerous and challenging stretches, until it became apparent that Harding had taken greater risks and done the route in a more adventurous style than Robbins had imagined. That night, Robbins hung in a bivouac hammock convulsed with self-doubt. He had convinced himself he had the moral authority to obliterate Wall of the Early Morning Light, but a voice inside told Robbins that envy was blinding his better judgment. The next morning, Robbins put away hammer and chisel and, without doing further harm, followed Harding’s route to the summit.

Mary Tyler Moore
She defined the idea of women in the workplace — while constantly in search of herself.
There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for “Ordinary People” in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment — what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?
He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he’d say: “No, no, clear your mind. Let’s go again.” Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it “the bane of the production.” He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a “mystified” crew, she wrote in her memoir.

A selection of beloved objects from those we lost.
“The last time he performed with that guitar was at Keith Richards’ place in Jamaica, where they were practicing for the movie “Hail! Hail! Rock ’n’ Roll.” It’s the guitar on which he wrote “Johnny B. Goode,” which ended up on the Voyager. There are these space probes out there with gold-plated, copper records of “Johnny B. Goode.” He loved smaller audiences. He performed 209 times at my restaurant. Sometimes he would nudge the keyboard player aside and play piano. When he was really feeling it, he would sling his long leg up and then let it hit the ground, and the band would know to stop, and he would start reciting poetry or tell a joke. He intuitively choreographed the greatest stage moves — playing the guitar behind his back! He made the guitar a star.”Joe Edwards, owner of Blueberry Hill

Dick Gregory
He chose standing up for black people over stand-up.
If you scan the thousands of pages of Richard Claxton Gregory’s F.B.I. file the way he scanned newspapers and magazines, mining information for material for his comedy, you will find yourself constantly landing on “racial matter” — a phrase preferred by the agency. The file tracks the rare trajectory of a man who made an enormously successful show-business career a footnote to his activism.
Gregory didn’t want people’s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment — so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J. Edgar Hoover by telegram: “I ADVOCATE AND ENCOURAGE ALL FBI AGENTS TO GO AFTER DICK GREGORY IN FULL FORCE. LET NOT ANYONE STOP YOU.”

Jane Juska
She transcended a strict upbringing and embraced her eroticism in her 60s.
You are a 66-year-old mother and retired high-school English teacher, bred in a small, puritanical Ohio town. Though you’ve been divorced for 30 years and celibate for almost that long, your life is full in many ways, teaching a college education course, volunteering as a writing instructor at San Quentin State Prison, escorting women for abortions at Planned Parenthood.
None of it compensates for the lack of a man’s touch. The conventional avenues for dating at your age — senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) — have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. “Before I turn 67 — next March — I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.”

Scharlette Holdman
Trying to find out how murderers were made, in order to save their lives.
She lived in a tiny New Orleans cottage filled with Cajun barbecue, Palestinian tapestries, books on torture, dirty jokes and stacks of academic papers on topics like the effects of neurotoxins in fertilizers. For a while there was a deceased inmate in a pine box in her yard, because she believed he deserved a respectful burial, and when no one in his family offered to provide one, she took him home. Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, whom she defended against the death penalty, tried to give her his cabin, but the government wouldn’t let her keep it. Sister Helen Prejean liked to come over and play a card game called Beat Your Ass. “Well, hey, come in, come in, come in,” Scharlette Holdman said to everyone who walked onto her screened porch. Her Tennessee drawl, pale skin and wispy blond hair were hard to square with her radical, irreverent, voracious mind. She once fell in love with a man who knocked on her door impersonating the hunchback Igor.
Holdman developed the field of death-penalty mitigation, a dry, abstract term for the floridly fascinating practice of humanizing defendants enough to keep the state from killing them. Her clients — Jared Loughner, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Eric Rudolph among them — were hard to love, yet she loved them anyway, and not for sappy or religious reasons. Holdman believed monsters, as the state painted her defendants to be, were made, not born. One question animated her life:What happened to turn you into a person capable of doing this?She understood that if you dug deeply enough into a person’s history, two or three generations if necessary, you would find the original wound, and if you understood the wound and traced its downstream effects, you would care enough to preserve a person’s life.

Adam West
A superhero for his life and times.
He was 37, and had been a Hollywood B-lister for almost a decade. Every now and then he landed a choice small part — there was that movie with Paul Newman — but his career was mostly a succession of failed TV pilots (eventually 13 in all) and roles in which he was, as he would later write, “shot up, beat up or put on trial.” Just when it looked as if the big break would never come, he was offered a part that might finally make him a household name, help him forget that he was once billed below a chimp. But there was a catch — the character was a comic-book figure already adored, or at least known, by legions. There would beexpectations. And even if he got it right, he risked being typecast for the rest of his career, like most every other actor who ever played a superhero.
This was the dilemma facing Adam West, the former William West Anderson, as he contemplated becoming TV’s Batman in the fall of 1965. He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different — not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they’d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.

Maryam Mirzakhani
She drew her way to mathematical greatness.
Maryam Mirzakhani was a mathematician, but she worked like an artist, always drawing. She liked to crouch on the floor with large sheets of paper, filling them with doodles: repeated floral figures and bulbous, rubbery bodies, their appendages sliced clean away, like denizens of a lost Miyazaki anime. One of her Stanford University graduate students said Mirzakhani portrayed problems in mathematics not as daunting logical conundrums but as animated tableaus. “It’s almost like she had a window on the math landscape, and she was trying to describe how the things living there interacted with each other,” says Jenya Sapir, now an assistant professor at Binghamton University. “To her, it’s all happening at once.”
Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city’s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes — except math. Near the school year’s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she’d had it when it came to math: “I’m not even going to try to do better.” Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject’s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.

Barkley Hendricks
He rejected the label of black political painter.
For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them — in different styles, in different media, in different orders — until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. “You’re in college,” he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.
At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered “intense.” (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: “Knows what he’s doing but kinda mean about it,” read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus. Another wrote, “Consider taking his courses during 2nd semester because he hates winter, so he’s more sympathetic when grades close in the spring!”

Irina Ratushinskaya
How to be free in the gulag.
At the end of a school day when Irina Ratushinskaya was a fifth grader in the 1960s in Odessa, her teacher stepped out of class and an exuberant student seized the moment to throw a chestnut across the room. The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: “I don’t know, I didn’t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.” But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, “I’m not going to tell you.” His answer was a revelation. “It hadn’t even entered my head to say that,” she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, “In the Beginning” (1991). “How ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!”
A poet who became an anti-Soviet activist in her 20s, Ratushinskaya was among the last wave of dissidents whose efforts helped to bring down the Soviet Union. In her years of being harassed, arrested, tried, imprisoned and tortured by the Soviets, she would get far on versions ofI’m not going to tell you.

Enrico L. Quarantelli
He proved that disasters bring out the best in us.
He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking — also, everything the people he was watching didn’t see. “Last observation to make,” he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. “It was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.” He’d been sitting in that office since Sunday.
Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. “I was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,” he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, “For some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,” he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (“The premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,” as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, “This is a different world than what had been assumed.”

DeMarlon Thomas
Even a president’s clemency couldn’t save him.
DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.
As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw’s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas’s life, home for him was at Grandma’s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: “After football practice, he’d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they’d curl up and talk about their day. He’d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.” If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, “Well, you can just spend the night with us” — and she often did.

Shirley Childress Johnson
She learned from an early age how to convey music without sound.
Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson’s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people’s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to “ventilate her feelings.”
She viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women’s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher’s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.

He walked in the footsteps of a black explorer who was forgotten by time.
By the time S. Allen Counter got to Greenland in 1986, he had already lived many other lives — Harvard neurophysiologist, explorer, ethnographer, social-justice advocate. But in the howling hinterland, he was just a man possessed by a ghost so powerful that he had followed it into an icy hell. And Counter couldn’t believe his good fortune: to have the privilege of freezing in an igloo among the Inuit, eating walrus heart andkiviaq, little winged auks fermented in sealskin. He was giddy, set down in all of this blank space, searching out justice for a dead black man whose story had been lost under a snowdrift of white history.
Counter, a friend once wrote, was “the most interesting man in the world.” Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life — segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms — but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.

Delia Graff Fara
She philosophized about vagueness — and lived with it too.
The “paradox of the heap” seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.
Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?

A hustler who built a fortune on a fish tale.
“The most profound change in my life,” Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer’s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.
“Yes, there are discus fishes near here,” the priest said. “But we also have neon tetras!” The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with “the largest neons I had ever seen” — and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren’t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.

A sheltered daughter on TV, she had to fend for herself when the cameras were off.
Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching “Happy Days” consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the ’50s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.
In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.

Maggie Roche
The songs she sang with her sisters were full of joy and harmony — the exact things she struggled to wring out of life.
For their devoted fan base, the Roches’ otherworldly harmonies were like an idealized sound of family. These three sisters’ voices could fly in tight formation across vast long notes and wild melodic curlicues. They could break into plaintive individual solos. The Roches were a quintessential band apart, united in a shared language.
But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January. Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches’ breezy, blended sound. Maggie’s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.

“He has been collecting collage material since he was in college. In a sense, it’s how he writes a poem: using fragments of conversation or something he heard on TV, juxtaposing things and creating environments. Collage is central to his process. It was very much trial and error. You can’t really describe what his collages are specifically about, but they deal with the process and language itself. He was, perhaps, communicating the feeling of creativity.”David Kermani, husband

Ren Hang
His photographs scandalized his country.
Jun Sui didn’t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren’s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. “There was a sense of being free,” Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren’s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. “We hide the body in our culture,” Ren once said; in China, it is “a demoralization to show what they think should be private.” Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.
Ren once described his work as “satisfying a thirst.” He found beauty in almost everything — a person, a snake, a flower — and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating — into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. “What’s with all the pee in your photos?” the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. “I like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,” he said. In other words, urinating isn’t scandalous or erotic — it’s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.

Cheo
The mainland disappointed him. Puerto Rico was his home.
Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia’s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.
In their cliff-side homes, Heredia’s family members were hard to reach even in good weather. Sabana Grande Alta, their village, translates roughly to “big blanket in the hills,” a reference to vegetation that grows thicker as you move up into the mountains until it envelopes everything in sight. Bright green leaves seem to grow from everywhere and nowhere; they creep onto the stucco walls and tin roofs of the tiny homes, blending them into their surroundings. Bushes, fruit trees and wildflowers grow back so quickly that people traveling by foot do so with a machete to cut a path to their destination. Thejíbaros, or hill people of Puerto Rico, are known for their ingenuity: They ride bareback on horses and raise chickens and rabbits in their backyards, cooking them into rich stews in their outdoor kitchens.

Derek Walcott
When the poet claimed his place on the world stage, he took a tiny island with him.
Derek Walcott’s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history — a derelict Caribbean outpost of England’s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.
In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.

Glen Campbell
His essential loneliness transcended the rhinestone image.
Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer’s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of “Glen Campbell” became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to “Wichita Lineman” and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing — with unaffected honesty — about something those other groups weren’t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late ’60s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play “Wichita Lineman” alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb’s lyrics — “And I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time” — were never exactly cool, but they didn’t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.
But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, “The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.” Though there was nothing “good time” about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from “Gentle on My Mind” onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of “the South” to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of “Tobacco Road” gave way to the vision of “Hee Haw,” the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in “Smokey and the Bandit” and Bo and Luke in “The Dukes of Hazzard” became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the “Glen Campbell” who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film “Norwood,” Campbell was saddled with the moniker “Goodtime Glen.”

Roy Dotrice
The voice that brought the voices of Westeros to life in your head.
The experience of being read to, whether it’s toddlers nodding off to “Goodnight Moon” at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of “Great Expectations,” is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader’s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover’s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.
Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice’s reading of George R. R. Martin’s epic fantasy series, “A Song of Ice and Fire,” the source material for HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin’s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind’s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series “Beauty and the Beast,” recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice’s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.

Pioneer Cabin Tree
When we can no longer pass through the giant sequoia.
The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.
The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.

"**Title: The High-Stakes Clash for the Soul of Climbing: Dominance and Resilience in the Vertical World**

**By [Your Name] | Date: October [Insert Date], 2023**

In the world of climbing, where physical prowess meets an almost spiritual connection to nature, an unexpected rift has developed between two titans of the sport. In a backdrop defined by sheer cliffs and rugged terrain, one climber's mettle has dramatically eclipsed his competitor, a rivalry that has captivated enthusiasts and reshaped the ethos of climbing.

### The Emergence of a Contender

At the crux of this narrative is Alex Johnson, a name that has resonated within climbing communities for over a decade. Johnson’s ascent in the sport has not only been marked by astonishing technical skill but also by his emphasis on inclusivity and the psychological aspects of climbing. Opposing him is Ryan McKenzie, a veteran climber whose traditional and aggressive approach has garnered both admiration and criticism. McKenzie, often seen on the podiums of prestigious competitions, has championed a ""win at all costs"" mentality that stands in stark contrast to Johnson’s philosophy.

### Prelude to Conflict

The friction between Johnson and McKenzie became evident during the recent climbers' summit, a gathering designed to promote fraternity among climbers while addressing pressing issues such as access to climbing areas and sustainability practices. As leaders of their respective factions, the two engaged in a spirited debate, highlighting the divide between those who view climbing as a competitive sport and others who regard it as an expression of individuality and connection with nature. The stakes were raised when both climbers committed to competing in the upcoming International Climbing Championship, set to take place in Sierra Nevada, a hallowed ground for climbers that has become a battleground for ideologies.

### The Climactic Showdown

As the championship approached, the mounting tension was palpable. Both climbers unleashed rigorous training regimes, each vying for supremacy not just on the walls but also in the hearts of fellow climbers. Johnson’s approach focused on innovative techniques and mental fortitude, while McKenzie emphasized brute strength and competitive aggression.

On the day of the competition, climbers and spectators alike flocked to the event, where sections of challenging routes were designed to test every facet of climbing acumen. McKenzie’s early lead sparked a wave of enthusiasm, but it was Johnson’s methodical approach and resilience that captivated the audience. With each bolt and hold, Johnson displayed not only technical mastery but also a deep respect for the mountain, eliciting cheers for his poise under pressure.

### The Turning Point

As the route neared its climax, it became clear that this was not just a competition of speed but a symbolic moment that would define the future of the sport. In a breathtaking display, Johnson not only matched McKenzie’s time but also demonstrated a climber's grace that transcended the competition. His ascent was emblematic of a growing movement within climbing that champions connection over competition—an “eraser” of the traditional tensions that McKenzie embodies.

The crowd erupted in applause as Johnson made his final reach for the summit. He stood atop the cliff, arms wide open, proclaiming a new era of climbing—a community-centric approach that embraces diversity, mental well-being, and environmental stewardship.

### Aftermath and Reflection

With Johnson’s victory, the implications ripple far beyond the championship title. He has emerged not just as a champion of the sport but as a leader advocating for a more inclusive climbing culture. McKenzie, graciously acknowledging Johnson’s triumph, has reconsidered his stance on competition, hinting at potential collaborations that may bridge the divide between their philosophies. 

As the dust settles from this climactic duel, the climbing community stands at a pivotal crossroads. Johnson’s victory not only marks a personal achievement but also signifies an evolving understanding of what it means to climb. In this battle for the soul of climbing, a new paradigm has emerged—one that values authenticity, resilience, and collective progress over individual glory.

### Conclusion

As climbing continues to grow in popularity and complexity, the dynamics among its leaders will shape its future. The confrontation between Johnson and McKenzie will undoubtedly be analyzed and debated for generations to come, serving as a reminder that even in the fiercest of competitions, the essence of climbing lies in the shared experiences that connect us all to the rock faces we love.

Alzheimer’s Takes a Financial Toll Long Before Diagnosis, Study Finds
New research shows that people who develop dementia often begin falling behind on bills years earlier.
ByBen Casselman
Long before people develop dementia, they often begin falling behind on mortgage payments, credit card bills and other financial obligations, new research shows.
A team of economists and medical experts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Georgetown University combined Medicare records with data from Equifax, the credit bureau, tostudy how people’s borrowing behavior changedin the years before and after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s or a similar disorder.
What they found was striking: Credit scores among people who later develop dementia begin falling sharply long before their disease is formally identified. A year before diagnosis, these people were 17.2 percent more likely to be delinquent on their mortgage payments than before the onset of the disease, and 34.3 percent more likely to be delinquent on their credit card bills. The issues start even earlier: The study finds evidence of people falling behind on their debts five years before diagnosis.
“The results are striking in both their clarity and their consistency,” said Carole Roan Gresenz, a Georgetown University economist who was one of the study’s authors. Credit scores and delinquencies, she said, “consistently worsen over time as diagnosis approaches, and so it literally mirrors the changes in cognitive decline that we’re observing.”
The research adds to agrowing body of workdocumenting what many Alzheimer’s patients and their families already know: Decision-making, including on financial matters, can begin to deteriorate long before a diagnosis is made or even suspected. People who are starting to experience cognitive decline may miss payments, make impulsive purchases or put money into risky investments they would not have considered before the disease.
“There’s not just getting forgetful, but our risk tolerance changes,” said Lauren Hersch Nicholas, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who hasstudied dementia’s impacton people’s finances. “It might seem suddenly like a good move to move a diversified financial portfolio into some stock that someone recommended.”

"**Alzheimer’s Takes a Financial Toll Long Before Diagnosis, Study Finds**

*By [Author Name]*  
*Published: [Date]*  

In a startling revelation underscored by a recent study, researchers have found that the financial repercussions of Alzheimer’s disease often begin much earlier than the clinical diagnosis of the condition. The implications of these findings could reshape how caregivers, families, and health care systems address financial planning and support for those affected by Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.

**Understanding the Financial Impact**

The study, published in the *Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease*, tracked financial data from individuals who later received an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, comparing it with a control group without dementia. Researchers examined a range of financial indicators, including out-of-pocket medical expenses, income decline, and retirement savings depletion.

The analysis revealed that participants who went on to develop Alzheimer’s experienced a significant decrease in their financial health starting up to six years prior to their official diagnosis. Notably, their out-of-pocket medical expenses doubled, while income from employment decreased sharply as cognitive decline affected their ability to work.

**Key Findings**

1. **Increased Medical Expenses**: The study found that individuals with preclinical signs of Alzheimer’s had medical expenses that were 49% higher on average compared to their cognitively healthy peers. This rise in costs often included expenses related to diagnostic tests, doctor visits, and early treatments or interventions.

2. **Income Decline**: Participants showed a progressive decline in income, correlating with the onset of subtle cognitive symptoms. A significant 27% drop in income was noted in the years preceding the diagnosis, attributed largely to reduced work hours or early retirement driven by declining mental acuity.

3. **Retirement Savings Depletion**: Those nearing a diagnosis drained their savings at an alarming rate. On average, retirement savings diminished by up to 30%, with many participants forced to dip into their savings to cover both increased medical and everyday living expenses.

**Implications for Families and Caregivers**

The findings highlight the urgent need for families to engage in early financial planning in anticipation of Alzheimer’s-related costs. Dr. [First Last Name], a lead author of the study, stated, “Most families are unprepared for the financial burden that Alzheimer’s can impose, and our study emphasizes the importance of proactive financial management in the years leading up to a diagnosis.”

**Recommendations for Financial Planning**

Experts recommend several strategies for families navigating the financial implications of Alzheimer’s:

- **Early Assessment**: Regular assessments of both cognitive function and financial health can help families gauge risk and prepare adequately for potential challenges.
  
- **Advance Care Planning**: Establishing durable powers of attorney, wills, and health care proxies can safeguard against future uncertainties.
  
- **Financial Counseling**: Consulting financial advisors who specialize in elder care can provide families with tailored strategies to manage both short-term expenses and long-term savings.

**Conclusion**

As the incidence of Alzheimer’s continues to rise, understanding its financial implications is crucial for affected individuals and families. This study serves as a clarion call for early intervention—not just from a health perspective, but also regarding financial preparedness. By confronting the financial realities of Alzheimer’s head-on, families can better navigate the complex journey ahead.

"### Is the Period Facing Extinction? Linguist David Crystal's Provocative Assessment

In an age where communication methods and styles are rapidly evolving, the iconic period—a punctuation mark steeped in history—faces an uncertain future. Renowned linguist David Crystal, who has extensively studied the evolution of language and communication, offers an intriguing perspective on this topic. He argues that the period, once considered essential for demarcating the end of a sentence, may be diminishing in relevance. Crystal's assertions raise important questions about the nature of modern communication and the implications for language as we know it.

#### The Historical Significance of the Period

The period has its roots in ancient writing systems and has played a crucial role in the development of written language. Its primary function is to signify the end of a declarative sentence, providing a clear stopping point for readers. This clarity has been pivotal in helping readers grasp the structure and meaning of written discourse. Yet, as Crystal points out, the way people communicate is transforming, thanks in large part to digital platforms that favor brevity and immediacy.

#### The Digital Age and Changing Communication Styles

The rise of texting, social media, and instant messaging has altered the landscape of communication. Crystal observes that these formats often encourage a more casual and rapid exchange of ideas, where the traditional rules of grammar and punctuation are frequently relaxed or ignored. The period, in particular, is often perceived as adding an unwanted formality to a conversation. As a result, many users opt for punctuation-free messages, leaving out the period altogether in favor of a more fluid style of communication.

Furthermore, the use of emojis and other visual aids has largely replaced the need for certain punctuation marks to convey tone or sentiment. A simple smiley face can express a sense of closure that a period once provided, leading to a shift in how people interpret the end of a statement.

#### The Impact of Language Evolution on the Period

Crystal emphasizes that language is not static; it is constantly evolving in response to changes in culture, technology, and social practices. While the decline of the period may seem alarming to traditionalists, Crystal argues that this phenomenon should be seen within the broader context of linguistic evolution. Just as languages have adapted over centuries to the needs of their speakers, so too is contemporary communication adapting to the preferences of digital natives.

The implications of this shift are profound. As younger generations gravitate toward more fluid, informal communication methods, the relevance of the period as a marker of sentence completion may continue to wane. Crystal asserts that this is not necessarily a decline in linguistic capability, but rather an evolution reflecting new communicative behaviors.

#### Conclusion: The Future of the Period

In conclusion, David Crystal's examination of the period invites reflection on how we communicate in the contemporary era. The potential decline of the period serves as a reminder that language is a living, breathing entity, constantly shaped by the contexts in which it is used. While the period may be losing its prominence in digital conversations, it is crucial to recognize that this evolution is part of a larger narrative about the dynamics of language and communication.

As we navigate an increasingly digital world, one must wonder: Will the period become an artifact of the past, or will it find a new role in the tapestry of modern expression? Only time will tell, but for now, the conversation is far from over.",ai,"Why does David Crystal believe the period, one of the oldest forms of punctuation, may be dying?"

Donald Trump Laments Loss of Aerosol Sprays to Frame His Hair
Donald J. Trump appears to be more concerned about the quality of his hair than the quality of the air.
Mr. Trump has offered little in the way of an environmental policy during his presidential campaign, but on Wednesday he said that President Obama’s concerns about the environment were infringing
                                                on his rights as a consumer. More pressing than saving the ozone layer, he suggested, was the freedom to buy aerosol hairspray.
“You can’t use hairspray because hairspray is going to affect the ozone,”Mr. Trump said during a rally in South Carolina.
                                                “They don’t want me to use hairspray, they want me to use the pump.”
Mr. Trump’s singular hairstyle has been the subject of widespread speculation over the years, and on Wednesday he made it clear that he gave considerable thought to maintaining his signature look.
Imitating the “bing, bing, bing” sound that his current hair product makes when he applies it with a pump, Mr. Trump revealed that he had a strong preference for old-fashioned aerosol sprays.
“It comes out in big globs, right, and it’s stuck in your hair and you say, ‘Oh my God, I’ve got to take a shower again, my hair is all screwed up,’” Mr. Trump lamented to
                                                a laughing audience.
Aerosol sprays were actually phased out in the United States in the 1990s, years before Mr. Obama was president, and the ban resulted from the Montreal Protocol in 1987, signed by President George H. W. Bush,
                                                which sought to curtail the damage aerosol products did to the disappearing ozone layer. Since then, the hairspray industry has been able to find substitutes that produce the same misty effect of CFCs and
                                                aerosol.
The Obama administration has made reducing carbon emissions a crucial part of its agenda to combat global warming. But Mr. Trump said that the president was a hypocrite on the issue because he flies around the
                                                world in the antiquated Air Force One, releasing harmful toxins.
For his part, Mr. Trump said that he did his spraying inside his well-sealed Manhattan penthouse, inflicting little damage on the atmosphere.
“I don’t think anything gets out,” Mr. Trump said of the pollutants he emits while taming his hair.

"**Title: Trump Defends Consumer Rights Amid Environmental Concerns Raised by Obama**

**By [Author’s Name]**  
**Date: [Insert Date]**  
**Location: Washington, D.C.**

In a recent statement, former President Donald Trump addressed concerns raised by President Barack Obama regarding environmental regulations, asserting that such measures infringe upon individual rights, particularly those of consumers. This declaration has reignited the longstanding debate between economic development and environmental stewardship in American politics.

### The Context of Trump’s Comments

During a rally in [Location], Trump remarked, ""President Obama’s environmental regulations are a direct attack on your rights as a consumer. They limit choices, raise costs, and hurt working families."" This statement reflects Trump's ongoing stance against what he perceives as overregulation, a theme he prominently featured during his presidency.

Trump's comments come in the wake of Obama's recent remarks at a climate summit, where he emphasized the urgent need for stronger environmental protection measures to combat climate change. Obama criticized past and present leaders who push back against these regulations, arguing that environmental health is linked to the socio-economic well-being of all citizens.

### Clash of Ideologies

This rhetorical clash highlights a fundamental ideological divide in American governance. Supporters of Trump's viewpoint argue that excessive environmental regulations stifle economic growth and limit free market options for consumers. They contend that businesses should have the freedom to operate without stringent government oversight, which they assert can lead to innovation and job creation.

Conversely, environmental advocates, including Obama, argue that sustainable practices are essential to secure a livable future. They maintain that environmental degradation disproportionately affects disadvantaged communities and that regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring public health and safety.

### Implications for Policy and Politics

Trump's challenge to Obama's environmental advocacy signals a potential rallying point for right-leaning voters concerned about their consumer freedoms. As the 2024 presidential campaign heats up, environmental policies are likely to be a significant topic, with candidates poised to either support or dismantle existing regulations based on their message.

Critics of Trump argue that prioritizing consumer rights over environmental protection could lead to a regression in climate action, potentially exacerbating issues such as air and water pollution and contributing to the global climate crisis. Studies have shown that environmental regulations can lead to long-term economic benefits by fostering sustainable industries and protecting natural resources.

### A Growing Conversation

As both parties prepare for the upcoming election, the balance between protecting consumer rights and ensuring environmental sustainability remains a pivotal issue that resonates with a broad segment of the American populace. Engaging in this conversation is critical, as voters seek to understand the implications of each candidate's policies on their daily lives and future prospects.

In a world increasingly aware of climate change challenges, the discourse surrounding consumer rights versus environmental protections is likely to evolve further. The question remains whether leaders can effectively reconcile these two important priorities for a sustainable future.

### Conclusion

Trump's assertion that environmental regulations infringe upon consumer rights reflects a deeper ideological debate in America about the role of government in regulating industry and protecting the environment. As political leaders navigate this intricate landscape, the dialogue will shape not only the immediate electoral landscape but also the legacy of environmental policy in the United States.

Auto Safety Regulator Investigating Tesla Recall of Autopilot
The National Highway Safety Administration also released an analysis of crashes involving the system that showed at least 29 fatal accidents over five and a half years.
ByJ. Edward Moreno
The federal government’s main auto safety agency said on Friday that it was investigating Tesla’s recall of its Autopilot driver-assistance system because regulators were concerned that the company had not done enough to ensure that drivers remained attentive while using the technology.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents posted on its website that it was looking into Tesla’srecallin December of two million vehicles, which covered nearly all of the cars the company had manufactured in the United States since 2012. The safety agency said it had concerns about crashes that took place after the recall and results from preliminary tests of recalled vehicles.
The agency also published an analysis that found that there had beenat least 29 fatal accidentsinvolving Autopilot and a more advanced system that Tesla calls Full Self-Driving from January 2018 to August 2023. In 13 of those fatal accidents, the fronts of Teslas hit objects or people in their path.
The investigation of Tesla’s recall and the new data about crashes adds to a list of headaches for Tesla, the dominant electric-vehicle maker in the United States. The company’s sales in the first three months of the year fell more than 8 percent from a year earlier, the first such drop since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.
Tesla announced in December that it would recall its Autopilot software after an investigation by the auto safety agency found that the carmaker hadn’t put in place enough safeguards to make sure the system, which can accelerate, brake and control cars in other ways, was used safely by drivers who were supposed to be ready at any moment to retake control of their cars using Autopilot.
In its analysis of Tesla crash data, the safety agency found that when the company’s cameras, sensors and software did not spot obstacles in the car’s path and drivers did not compensate for that failure quickly enough the consequences were often catastrophic.",human,Auto Safety Regulator Investigating Tesla Recall of Autopilot
"**Title: Auto Safety Regulator Investigates Tesla’s Autopilot Recall**

**Subtitle: Federal Review Underlines Ongoing Concerns About Autonomous Driving Technologies**

**By: [Your Name]  
Date: October 23, 2023**

In a significant development for the automotive industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched an investigation into Tesla’s recent recall related to its Autopilot system. This move highlights escalating scrutiny over the safety of automated driving technologies as the demand for advanced driver-assistance systems continues to grow.

### Background on the Recall

Tesla announced a recall affecting approximately 320,000 vehicles equipped with its Autopilot system, which is marketed as an advanced driver-assistance feature that allows cars to steer, accelerate, and brake automatically within certain conditions. The recall was prompted by concerns that certain versions of the software could misinterpret road conditions and fail to respond appropriately, posing risks to drivers and pedestrians alike.

This is not the first time Tesla has faced scrutiny over its Autopilot features. Previous investigations have examined several high-profile accidents involving Tesla vehicles operating under Autopilot, raising questions about the reliability of the technology and the adequacy of driver supervision.

### NHTSA’s Investigation

The NHTSA’s investigation will assess whether Tesla’s Autopilot system adequately complies with federal safety regulations and whether the recall was sufficient to address known defects in the system. The agency’s review will focus on:

1. **Software Integrity**: Analyzing the functionality of the software that controls the Autopilot feature and determining if its operational parameters are safe.
  
2. **Driver Notification**: Evaluating how well Tesla communicated the recall to affected vehicle owners, including the effectiveness of the notifications and urgency of the required updates.

3. **Previous Complaints**: Investigating any correlations between prior complaints or accidents involving Tesla's Autopilot and the current recall.

### Industry Response and Implications

The investigation has elicited mixed reactions from the automotive industry and consumer advocacy groups. Critics assert that the recall is a symptom of Tesla’s aggressive push toward fully autonomous vehicles without sufficient safety safeguards. “Software bugs in critical driving systems can have catastrophic consequences,” said John Smith, a safety expert at the Consumer Federation of America. “The industry must prioritize safety over speed.”

On the other hand, proponents argue that Tesla is being unfairly targeted. They posit that the continuous updates to Autopilot are part of a rapidly evolving technology, and that many other manufacturers are also grappling with similar challenges in their driving assistance systems.

### Moving Forward

The NHTSA’s investigation is poised to set important precedents for the regulation of autonomous driving technologies. With the agency already ramping up oversight, the outcomes of this probe may influence future regulatory frameworks across the industry. 

As part of the ongoing examination, Tesla has committed to cooperating fully with the NHTSA. The company reiterated its dedication to safety and innovation through a public statement emphasizing that recalls are a standard aspect of vehicle manufacturing that underscores its commitment to consumer safety.

### Conclusion

As Tesla navigates this investigation, the recall of its Autopilot system serves as a critical juncture for both the company and the auto industry at large. With the rapid advancement of autonomous technologies, the need for robust safety measures and regulatory oversight has never been more pressing. Stakeholders will be closely watching how this situation unfolds, as it may greatly impact consumer confidence in autonomous driving systems and the future of vehicle automation.

"**Title: Representative Dan Crenshaw Emphasizes American Heroism at the Republican National Convention**

*Date: [Insert Date]*  
*By: [Insert Author Name]*

In a stirring address during the Republican National Convention, Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas captured the attention of attendees and viewers alike with a compelling narrative of American heroism, drawing from his experiences as a Navy SEAL in Afghanistan. The speech resonated deeply with the themes of sacrifice, resilience, and patriotism, reflecting a pivotal moment in Crenshaw’s political journey and the larger national discourse.

**Opening Remarks: A Personal Journey**

Kicking off his address, Crenshaw recounted his journey from the battlefield to Congress, sharing poignant anecdotes from his time in Afghanistan. The Congressman, who lost an eye during a deployment, recounted the harrowing moments of combat that tested not only his physical limits but also his spirit. His unyielding commitment to serving his country emerged as a central theme, inviting the audience to reflect on the sacrifices made by millions of American service members.

**The Essence of Heroism**

Crenshaw's speech painted a vivid picture of what it means to be a hero in today’s America. He defined heroism not solely in terms of battlefield valor, but as a composite of courage, bravery, and the willingness to confront adversity head-on. Citing various examples from military history, he implored listeners to recognize everyday acts of heroism among civilians—first responders, healthcare workers, and community leaders—who embody the spirit of resilience.

“Heroism isn’t just about wearing a uniform; it’s about the spirit that lies within each of us,” Crenshaw declared, challenging the audience to adopt this mindset in their daily lives. As he spoke, attendees were seen nodding in agreement, inspired by his message of inclusive heroism.

**Lessons from the Front Lines**

Crenshaw interwove his military experiences with the current political climate, arguing that the same resolve exemplified by service members should guide American citizens in the face of modern challenges. He underscored that the lessons learned in combat—the need for unity, trust, and determination—are equally relevant in political discourse.

Drawing parallels between the challenges faced in Afghanistan and the struggles Americans endure today, he urged unity across partisan lines. ""We are all on the same team,"" he stated, emphasizing the need for collaboration and mutual respect. The audience erupted in applause, resonating with his call for unity amid a climate of divisiveness.

**A Tribute to the Fallen**

As Crenshaw concluded his speech, he paid tribute to fallen heroes, reminding attendees of the ultimate sacrifices made by numerous soldiers. He highlighted the importance of remembering and honoring their legacies, reaffirming the idea that true heroism endures beyond the battlefield.

“Let us strive to be worthy of their sacrifices. Let us fight for the principles they stood for—freedom, justice, and the American way of life,” he implored, leaving the audience with stirring images of valor and patriotism.

**A Lasting Impact**

Crenshaw’s speech at the Republican National Convention not only resonated with party members but also with a broader audience eager for messages of hope and strength. His articulation of American heroism, rooted in personal experience and collective values, reinforced his position as a prominent voice within the Republican Party.

As the convention unfolds, Crenshaw's address stands as a reminder of the enduring power of heroism in shaping American identity—both on and off the battlefield. The Congressman’s compelling narrative of sacrifice and resilience promises to echo in the hearts and minds of constituents long after the final gavel falls.

‘I’m Just Overjoyed’: Boston Marathon Racers Rejoice After Lost Year
Thousands of competitors ran the 2021 Boston Marathon. The prestigious race restarted this year after being canceled in 2020 because of the pandemic.
Participants are asked to keep their mask on until they reach the start line. Good job, good job. Congratulations to all the the folks that qualified. And you’re off! I’m feeling so overwhelmed. I’ve been training for this thing since, I don’t know, 2019, it feels like, because it got canceled in 2020. That was supposed to be my first time racing the Boston, so I’ve been waiting, like, two years to run it. And so I feel like I’ve been — Ohh, I’m just overjoyed. All that training, this is the big dance. This is what it pays off. Oh, my goodness. After the pandemic, after all we’ve been through, I am so happy to be here. I am super happy that Kenya won both men and women. I am so excited. And it feels great. It really feels great. You’ve got a lot of people behind you. See what you’ve done? You are Boston strong. I recently had an elder passed away up in our state, Emmett Eastman. He was a great inspiration to me. The guy ran up all the way until he was 80, and he was an international runner. And he talked about Boston when I was a kid and I thought I could never run that. And here I am today. Oh, this crowd doesn’t need any encouragement. You know what to do. The paralympic program. And once again they’re off. I saw all of the Boston survivors and they just motivate you, and the crowds motivate you, and you just keep going. There’s no reason not to go. There is no crying at the Boston Marathon.

"**Title: Celebrated Observer of Urban Life: Mr. Stettner Dies at 93**

**By [Your Name]**

**Date: [Insert Date]**

Mr. Stettner, the distinguished artist and chronicler of life in New York and Paris, passed away on Thursday at the age of 93. Renowned for his keen observations and profound understanding of the human experience in these two vibrant cities, Stettner's work illuminated the spirit of urban life, earning him a cherished place in both art and literature.

**The Duality of His Cities**

Born in 1930 in New York City, Stettner often referred to New York and Paris as his “spiritual mothers.” His upbringing in the bustling streets of Manhattan deeply influenced his artistic vision. He later spent a significant portion of his life in the French capital, where he absorbed its rich culture and bohemian spirit. ""These cities are alive in ways that words cannot capture,"" Stettner once said, encapsulating his philosophy that art should mirror the rhythm and chaos of urban life.

**Career Beginnings and Artistic Evolution**

Stettner’s early career was marked by a series of poignant illustrations and essays that captured everyday moments, from subway rides to quiet afternoons in Parisian cafés. His ability to depict the essence of city life garnered attention, leading to a burgeoning career that spanned decades. He published multiple volumes of poetry and prose, alongside a series of famed art exhibitions that showcased his unique interpretations of urban environments.

“Every corner of New York and Paris tells a story,” he said, often finding beauty in the mundane—whether it was a fleeting glance between strangers or a street vendor hawking wares. This narrative approach became a hallmark of his style, making his work accessible and relatable.

**Recognition and Influence**

Stettner’s contributions to the arts were recognized at numerous exhibitions, where he received accolades for his incisive portrayals of life in the two cities he loved. His collections often explore themes of identity, belonging, and the transformative power of place. Critics praised him for his ability to merge various artistic mediums, blending visual art with literary expression in a way that resonated with a broad audience.

In the 1980s, Stettner was awarded the prestigious *Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris*, highlighting his impact on the cultural discourse surrounding urban life. He continued to inspire generations of artists, writers, and thinkers who shared his passion for storytelling through observation.

**Legacy of the Urban Observer**

Mr. Stettner’s enduring legacy lies not just in his art, but in his philosophy regarding the impermanence of city life. ""Cities are living organisms,"" he wrote in his memoirs. ""They breathe, they grow, and they change. To capture that is to capture life itself."" This perspective challenged contemporaries to seek deeper narratives in the world around them, encouraging them to look beyond the surface.

As tributes pour in from admirers and fellow artists, it is clear that Stettner's work will continue to resonate in the artistic community and beyond. His unerring eye for detail and profound love for New York and Paris have left an indelible mark on the cultural tapestry of both cities.

**Conclusion**

Mr. Stettner's passing is a significant loss to the artistic community, but his voice and vision will endure through the art and literature he created. He will be remembered not only for his remarkable talent but also for his unwavering commitment to capturing the essence of life in two of the world's greatest cities. In his own words, “Art is the window through which we can glimpse the soul of our cities,” a sentiment he embodied throughout his remarkable life.

When Soumya Karlamangla, who lives in San Francisco, tells someone she works for The New York Times, the reaction is often the same: a look of confusion.
“People that I’m interviewing in the field will say, ‘Oh, they flew you out here for this?’” she said in a recent conversation. “I usually tell them that there’s a good number of Times reporters in California. We have two bureaus.”
Ms. Karlamangla, who writes theCalifornia Todaynewsletter, joined The Times in July 2021 from The Los Angeles Times, where she covered health care news.
“I was tired of writing about Covid-19,” she said. When The Times approached her with an opportunity to cover news in the Golden State, she didn’t hesitate.

"# A Look at California Today, and Tomorrow 

## Introduction
California, the Golden State, is known for its stunning landscapes, diverse cultures, and innovative spirit. As we venture into 2024, it becomes essential to reflect on the current state of California, highlighting its challenges and opportunities while peering into what the future may hold for this vibrant state.

## Today’s California

### Economic Landscape 
California boasts the largest economy in the United States and ranks among the top economies globally. As of 2023, the state's tech sector continues to thrive in Silicon Valley, contributing to its GDP, alongside significant contributions from entertainment in Hollywood, agriculture in the Central Valley, and tourism across its iconic destinations.

However, inflation and rising living costs, particularly in housing, pose significant challenges. Major urban centers like San Francisco and Los Angeles have been grappling with skyrocketing real estate prices, making homeownership increasingly unattainable for many residents. In response, the state has enacted measures to increase affordable housing development, but the demand continues to outstrip supply.

### Environmental Challenges 
California faces dire environmental challenges, including prolonged droughts, wildfires, and coastal erosion. The recent catastrophic wildfires have highlighted the urgent need for better forest management and climate resilience. Furthermore, water scarcity remains a pressing issue, compelling the state to implement stricter water conservation measures.

Despite these challenges, California remains a leader in environmental innovation. The state has made ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy use, aiming for a 100% clean energy grid by 2045.

### Social Dynamics 
California’s demographic landscape is rich and varied, characterized by its multicultural communities. Yet, issues of inequality persist, particularly regarding access to quality education and healthcare. The disparities have been laid bare during the pandemic, exacerbating existing social inequities.

In response to these social challenges, various grassroots organizations and community leaders are pushing for systemic reform. Promoting educational equity and access to healthcare is at the forefront of their missions, aiming to uplift marginalized communities across the state.

## Tomorrow’s California

### A Vision for the Future
Looking ahead, California’s future hinges on its ability to navigate its current challenges while embracing innovation and sustainability. As the state moves towards 2030, significant trends are expected to shape its trajectory.

#### Innovation and Technology 
The tech industry is poised to evolve, with advancements in AI, biotechnology, and green technologies. As companies adapt to new realities, California's tech hubs are likely to remain at the forefront of innovation, attracting talent from around the globe. However, the state must also address issues related to tech-driven displacement and work to ensure that its economic growth benefits all Californians.

#### Environmental Resilience 
Efforts to combat climate change are likely to intensify. California will continue to lead the way in renewable energy initiatives, aiming to set an example on a national and global scale. The state’s focus on transition to electric vehicles, solar energy, and sustainable agriculture will be crucial in reducing its carbon footprint and promoting environmental stewardship among residents.

#### Social Equity 
The future of California will also depend on its commitment to social justice and equity. Policies aimed at improving education, healthcare access, and economic opportunities for marginalized groups will be essential. The state is likely to see an increase in community-led initiatives designed to dismantle systemic barriers, allowing for a more inclusive society.

### Conclusion
California stands at a crossroads as it moves into 2024 and beyond. By addressing its challenges head-on, embracing innovation, and fostering social equity, the state can pave the way for a brighter, more sustainable future. The journey ahead will require collaboration and commitment from all sectors of society to ensure that California remains a land of opportunity for generations to come. 

As the nation looks to California as a bellwether for progress, the choices made today will undeniably shape the state—and the world—of tomorrow.",ai,"A Look at California Today, and Tomorrow"

The wordgentryhas appeared in 18 New York Times articles in the past year, including on Aug. 28 in “A Passion for Hurling, the All-Ireland Game”by Dan Barry:

The sport might be likened to a mash-up of lacrosse, field hockey and baseball, but even the most strained analogy “only gets you so far,” said Paul Rouse, a professor at University College Dublin
                                            who specializes in the history of sport.
… Through centuries of strife and English occupation, this Irish game somehow survived. In the Middle Ages, for example, English law banned adoption of various Irish customs, including hurling, “from
                                            which great evils and maims have arisen.”
For a while, the game enchanted thegentry, with landlords fielding teams to play other estates. But they gradually distanced themselves from the game, either having concluded that such Irish pursuits
                                            were beneath them or suspecting that hurling smacked of rebellious nationalism.

### The Multifaceted Meaning of Community

""Community"" is not merely a descriptor; it embodies the essence of human connection, solidarity, and shared experiences.

"**Title**: The Legislative Debate Over Gender Identity: A Look at State Representative Zooey Zephyr’s Dissent

**By [Author Name]**

**Date: October 20, 2023**  

**Location: [City, State]**  

In a contentious session at the state legislature, Representative Zooey Zephyr voiced strong opposition to a recently introduced bill aimed at defining gender solely as a binary construct. Testifying passionately before her colleagues, Zephyr condemned the legislation, stating, “This bill tries to define male and female as binary. You could not legislate binary sex any more than you could legislate that the Earth is flat.” Her remarks illustrate the broader cultural and political struggle surrounding the issue of gender identity, which continues to provoke heated debate across the nation.

**Context of the Bill**  
The proposed legislation seeks to establish a legal definition of gender as existing strictly within the parameters of male and female, effectively ignoring non-binary and genderqueer identities. Supporters of the bill argue that defining gender in binary terms simplifies legal matters concerning healthcare, education, and employment. However, critics assert that such a definition fails to consider the complexities of human identity and could have far-reaching implications for transgender and non-binary individuals.

**Key Arguments Against Legislation**  
Representative Zephyr’s statement resonates with many advocates who argue that identity cannot be constrained by a rigid binary. She elaborated on her perspective during a press conference, emphasizing that “gender is a spectrum and is influenced by a myriad of factors, including culture, biology, and personal experience.” By equating the legislation’s efforts to define gender with efforts to assert a scientifically disproven notion, such as the flatness of the Earth, Zephyr underscored the absurdity of attempting to legislate personal identity.

**The Impact on Communities**  
If passed, the bill could have significant consequences. Activists fear that it would undermine the rights and recognition of individuals who do not fit within the traditional male-female dichotomy. This could lead to increased discrimination, particularly in areas such as healthcare accessibility, where non-binary individuals may struggle to receive the appropriate care or face rejection from medical professionals who adhere strictly to binary definitions. “We cannot ignore the voices and experiences of people who do not identify with the binary,” Zephyr stated, highlighting the potential harm that such legislation could impose on marginalized communities.

**Support for the Legislation**  
Proponents of the bill, primarily from conservative factions, argue that the legislation is necessary for preserving traditional family structures and protecting children. They assert that guiding children’s understanding of gender through a binary lens ensures clarity and stability in a rapidly changing world. However, this assertion has drawn ire from opponents who caution against imposing outdated norms on a generation that is increasingly aware of and advocate for gender diversity.

**Public Reaction and Next Steps**  
Public opinion on the bill remains divided. Social media platforms are buzzing with discussions, with many supporters and opponents vocalizing their views. Grassroots organizations preparing to mobilize for a potential repeal have been galvanized by Zephyr’s passionate stand. As the bill moves toward a vote, representatives and advocacy groups alike are preparing rallies and campaigns to sway public sentiment.

As this legislative battle unfolds, one thing is clear: the conversation around gender identity in America is complex, fraught with passion, and unlikely to be settled any time soon. Representative Zooey Zephyr’s statement highlights not just a moment of dissent but a broader call for recognition and respect for all identities within the tapestry of human experience.

**Conclusion**  
The struggle over the definition of gender in legislative terms reflects a deeper cultural conflict that challenges our understandings of identity and self. As advocates push back against binary definitions, the outcomes of these debates will likely set important legal precedents for generations to come. Whether limited by law or broadened by understanding, the conversation about gender equality and recognition is far from over.

Poll Watch: What to Make of the ‘Sanders Surge’
As Senator Bernie Sandersappears to gain momentumin his race for the
                                                Democratic presidential nomination, the breadth and depth of his support remain uncertain.
Can he win the support of black and Latino voters, who remain relatively unfamiliar with him? What about women? And will the admiration he enjoys from younger voters, often amongthe least likelyto turn out to vote, materialize at caucuses and voting booths?
Thelatest New York Times/CBS News national pollshows Mr. Sanders well within striking distance of
                                                Hillary Clinton, attracting support from 41 percent of Democratic primary voters compared with her 48 percent. A poll released on Tuesday by Monmouth University reflected a similar narrowing in the race
                                                nationally, with Mr. Sanders cutting Mrs. Clinton’s lead in half since December.
And a CNN/WMUR poll, also out on Tuesday, showed Mr. Sanders surging to a commanding lead in New Hampshire — 60 percent to 33 percent — just three weeks before that state holds the country’s
                                                first primary.
But New Hampshire has among the lowest minority populations in the country, and its residents are more familiar with the senator from neighboring Vermont than are most Americans.
In national polls, Mr. Sanders’s key support groups remain white men and young voters. In the recent Times/CBS News poll, Mrs. Clinton kept her edge among voters over age 45, where she leads 63 percent
                                                to 25 percent.
And it must be noted that not all polls show Mr. Sanders pulling closer — the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll had Mrs. Clinton maintaining a 25-point lead nationally, essentially unchanged from
                                                December.
Still, he shows signs of encroaching on her advantage among once-reliable demographic groups. Since December, Mr. Sanders’s support among women rose to 39 percent from 29 percent, while Mrs. Clinton’s
                                                stayed at 53 percent. Among those who say they want the next president to generally continue President Obama’s policies, Mr. Sanders is chipping away at the former secretary of state’s support.
                                                In November, she led him by 28 points in this group; in January, her lead was half that.
Mr. Sanders often says his candidacy depends onigniting a political revolutionby mobilizing new voters, so it is hard to predict how many of his supporters can be relied on to actually vote. But the latest Times/CBS News poll showed that his supporters are no less likely to have voted
                                                in the past than were Mrs. Clinton’s: Seventy-four percent of Sanders backers had cast a ballot in a primary or caucus, compared with 71 percent of Clinton supporters.
Even among nonwhite voters, Mrs. Clinton’s advantage narrowed significantly in the January poll. She still led among nonwhite voters by more than two to one, 59 percent to 27 percent, but she was more
                                                dominant in December, when she was ahead by four to one.
At the Democratic debate on Sunday, Mr. Sanders insisted that his problem with minority voters was a lack of familiarity. “When the African-American community becomes familiar with my congressional record
                                                and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy and criminal justice, just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African-American community,” he said. “So
                                                will the Latino community. We have the momentum.”
According to Gallup, Mrs. Clinton is
                                                seen favorably by many more black Democrats — yet relatively few see Mr. Sanders unfavorably. Eighty-six percent view her favorably, while half that number, 43 percent, see Mr. Sanders favorably.
                                                But just 14 percent see him unfavorably, suggesting that he has a lot of room for growth.
The most recent survey data from South Carolina, where a majority of Democratic primary voters are black, is from November, before Mr. Sanders’s most recent surge. But the polling indicates the uphill
                                                climb that awaits him in the third state that will vote this year. The latest Monmouth University poll there showed Mrs. Clinton beating him three to one.

"**Title: The Rising Momentum of Bernie Sanders: A Complex Picture Ahead of the 2024 Democratic Primaries**

**By [Your Name]  
Date: [Insert Date Here]**

As Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont steps into the spotlight for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, observers are keenly noting the signs of a potential resurgence in his campaign. However, despite his growing presence on the political stage, the breadth and depth of his support remain uncertain, raising questions about his viability as a contender in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary season.

**I. Sanders’ Resurgence: A Look at the Numbers**

Recent polls have shown Sanders gaining traction among Democratic voters, particularly among younger demographics and those who prioritize progressive policies. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, Sanders is polling in the top tier of candidates, closely trailing incumbent President Joe Biden and other notable challengers. This uptick is reminiscent of his strong showing during the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, where he captivated a diverse coalition of supporters with his platform centered around healthcare for all, wealth inequality, and climate justice.

**II. The Strength of Sanders’ Base**

Sanders’ unique ability to tap into grassroots enthusiasm has remained a hallmark of his campaigns. His supporters, often described as “Bernie Bros,” extend beyond a singular demographic. They include a wide variety of individuals: young progressives, working-class voters, and even disillusioned moderates seeking change from the establishment. Organizations such as Our Revolution and the Sunrise Movement continue to rally behind him, emphasizing the need for a transformative agenda that addresses systemic injustices.

However, while his base is passionate, it is essential to analyze the cohesiveness and reach of that support across various demographic segments, particularly within the increasingly diverse Democratic Party. Polling data indicates that while Sanders enjoys robust backing from younger voters, his appeal among older voters and key demographic groups, such as Black and Latino electorates, remains less clear.

**III. The Challenges Ahead**

With his campaign gaining momentum, Sanders faces notable challenges. Critiques from both moderate Democrats and progressives who may view his approach as too radical could pose hurdles in building a broad coalition necessary to secure the nomination. Additionally, the political landscape has changed since his last campaign, as new candidates enter the race, each bringing their own vision for the future of the Democratic Party.

The Biden administration's handling of various issues, including the economy and foreign policy, also plays a crucial role in shaping the primary dynamics. As Sanders navigates this complex environment, he must effectively communicate his vision while also addressing concerns about electability against potential Republican challengers.

**IV. Deconstructing the Narrative**

As Sanders gains visibility, it is imperative to examine the narrative surrounding his campaign closely. Media portrayals often oscillate between framing him as the underdog versus a serious challenger. Analysts argue that this duality can significantly impact voter perception. Thus, the portrayal of Sanders in the media predominantly hinges on how his campaign can convey a compelling and relatable narrative, one that resonates with a diverse electorate.

**V. Conclusion: The Road Ahead**

As the caucuses and primaries approach, the race for the Democratic nomination remains fluid. While Senator Bernie Sanders appears to be gaining momentum, the uncertainty surrounding his support indicates that the journey to the nomination will be fraught with challenges. As voters assess their choices, questions about his appeal across a broader spectrum and the implications of a progressive agenda in a polarized political landscape will undoubtedly shape the upcoming primary season.

In the months leading up to the primaries, all eyes will be on Sanders as he refines his message and seeks to galvanize support. Whether he can channel this momentum into a winning coalition remains to be seen. The 2024 election promises to be a defining moment for the Democratic Party, and Sanders’ role within it could be pivotal in determining the party's direction moving forward.

"**The 77th Golden Globe Awards: A Night of Highs and Lows**  
*By [Reporter’s Name], NY Times*

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Location:** Beverly Hills, California  

As the curtain fell on the 77th Golden Globe Awards, held on Sunday evening at the Beverly Hilton, the event proved to be a night of both celebratory peaks and poignant valleys. Hosted by the charismatic Ricky Gervais, who returned for his fifth time at the helm, the Globes shone a spotlight on the crème de la crème of television and film, while also tackling the industry's pressing issues head-on.

**Red Carpet Revelations**  
The evening began with the star-studded red carpet, where Hollywood’s elite dazzled in an array of haute couture. From the enchanting elegance of Lupita Nyong’o's shimmering gown to the bold statements made by the cast of ""That One Show,"" the red carpet set the stage for the night ahead.

However, beneath the glamor was an undercurrent of activism. Many stars took the opportunity to voice their support for movements addressing inclusivity and representation within the industry. The presence of notable Hollywood figures advocating for change hinted at the need for a more equitable future.

**Major Wins and Heartwarming Moments**  
As the awards commenced, many anticipated the outcome of the coveted Best Motion Picture honors. Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" and Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" battled for supremacy, but it was ""1917"" that ultimately took home the award for Best Motion Picture - Drama, a moving narrative that resonated with audiences and critics alike.

In the television category, ""Succession"" continued to dominate, winning Best Television Series - Drama, while its star, Brian Cox, secured Best Actor - Television Series - Drama. The emotional acceptance speech delivered by the series producer, reflecting on the importance of storytelling in uncertain times, moved many in attendance.

One of the night’s standout moments occurred during Michelle Williams' acceptance speech for Best Actress in a Limited Series. Williams fervently discussed women’s rights and the importance of choice, igniting a fierce sense of inspiration in the audience.

**Controversies and Criticism**  
Yet, not all accolades were met with applause. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association faced scrutiny for its lack of diversity amongst its voting members, an ongoing concern that loomed over the ceremony. Critics voiced frustration over the omission of several deserving projects and artists of color from major categories, highlighting the need for systemic change within the organization.

Moreover, Gervais' sharply-tongued monologue drew mixed reactions. While some praised his irreverent humor, others felt his remarks skirted too close to disrespect, making the night feel more contentious than celebratory.

**The Performances: A Mixed Bag**  
The musical performances varied in reception. A lively rendition by the cast of ""The Prom"" energized the audience, while a more subdued performance by H.E.R. drew hushed tones as she delivered a soul-stirring tribute to Hollywood's enduring power of storytelling. The contrasting styles underscored the eclectic nature of the entertainment landscape.

**Final Thoughts**  
As the night drew to a close, the 77th Golden Globe Awards served as both a celebration of artistic achievement and a reflective mirror to Hollywood’s ongoing battles with diversity, representation, and the role of celebrity in advocacy. Moments of joy were intertwined with calls for change, capturing the complicated essence of the industry itself. While luminaries are recognized for their brilliance, the conversation of inclusivity remains a vital thread woven into the fabric of future ceremonies.

As we look toward the next awards season, the questions raised and the celebrations had at the Golden Globes remind us all: in the world of entertainment, the highs can often shine brighter when coupled with meaningful dialogue about the lows.
